− mr president firstly i would like to congratulate mr seeber on the work he has done because his report picks up many of the concerns expressed in this
in this house regarding problems that are crucial for the whole of the european union water scarcity and drought which have now ceased to be a problem for only the southern european countries
i am pleased that this draft incorporates some of the ideas included in the opinion for which i was the draftsman in the committee on agriculture and rural development in favour of agricultural activity for example in highlighting the role that farmers play in the sustainable management of available resources
it also includes a reference to droughts and water scarcity as factors that push up the prices of raw materials an aspect which in the current climate i think it is very important to highlight so that we keep in mind not only the environmental dimension of this problem but also some of its most important economic consequences
the committee on the environment public health and food safety also included the idea of establishing a european drought observatory something that is also mentioned in the opinion of the committee on agriculture and which i hope will one day become a reality
the text to be put to the vote tomorrow does not however include a proposal made by the committee on agriculture for the commission to look into setting up an economic adaptation fund against drought which would benefit all economic sectors including agriculture
i would personally like to make it clear that i will continue to advocate the establishment of this fund an idea that i will propose to parliament again when the commission produces its planned communication on adaptation to climate change in the next few months
i think that following the establishment of the solidarity fund which was created to mitigate the losses caused by climate disasters it is time for us to think about an instrument that acts in advance to fund preventive measures to reduce the environmental and financial cost of these climate disasters
atlético madrid its fans and even the spanish police are being mistreated by the union of european football associations
however the problem is wider than this as these federative bodies tend to increase sanctions when people resort to the ordinary courts
this mediaeval concept of one law for me and another for you is contrary to our law and the european institutions
we must therefore react in fact we will end up having to react as these arbitrary mediaeval tyrants must abide by the law and the ordinary procedural guarantees of our europe
mr president commissioner terrorism and serious organised crime are global phenomena the means for fighting these must therefore be proportional and effective
i took due note of the answers given to the questions these answers were quite correct it is true that guarantees must be demanded and that this is a delicate issue however it is also true that it is absolutely inexcusable to provide a globalised and harmonised response
those people who are somewhat detached from terrorism are more concerned about individual guarantees
my concern is for both individual and collective guarantees it is absolutely vital that we start where we can
if we have to start with air transport given that air carriers already have this data then that is where we must start
we will demand guarantees we will assess the scope and we will start with international transport however it should be noted that we will then move on to domestic transport because terrorists very often do not come from outside but are home grown
ask the united states and everyone else because that is how it is and that is how we will have to address it in the future
mr president i want to thank the commission for having presented this proposal
i believe it is positive and will help us to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens
as previous speakers have said this parliament has a duty to bring down to earth the commission s very generous and very altruistic proposals
the reality is that we have twenty seven countries with different legal systems and very different languages which means that in each country we must adapt to the realities of that country including on the issue of languages
however as mentioned just now by mr gauzès and also by previous speakers it is vital that the recognition of these national specificities does not lead to increased costs that fees are uniform and that governments if necessary shoulder this additional cost
however there is also another issue the issue of translations
in the european union we do not have a common language
different languages are spoken in all the twenty seven countries and even within some of these countries such as the commissioner s we have to live with this
also in legal terms we are faced with a reality in which legal documents differ
the committee on legal affairs has for example proposed amendments on the certification of documents together with the certification of translations
at this moment in time the committee on legal affairs is preparing a report on the recognition of certified documents in various european union countries which should complement this report
finally i believe that the commission has done well in presenting this proposal
the rapporteur has done a magnificent job and we have all tried to develop a proposal for a legislative text that can be recognised throughout the union thus guaranteeing rights
rights and which is based on the reality of a union that is still being constructed that has different national legal systems and that has different levels of access to electronic communications
mr president the vast majority of farmers and stockbreeders are waiting on the decisions and agreements that the agriculture and fisheries council will adopt between today and thursday on this common agricultural policy health check
common agricultural policy health check they are waiting because this is not a simple review but will lead to profound changes such as the disappearance of many holdings if the cuts in direct aid proposed by the european commission go ahead
modulation is the central point of this parliamentary report and could be one of the few elements in parliament s opinion with some impact on the negotiations being conducted by the e u s agriculture ministers
for years we have been opposing any increase in what we euphemistically call modulation because if the rural development policy lacks sufficient funds this is not
due to a lack of resources within the c a p budget but rather due to the total lack of political will to provide an adequate community budget for this essential pillar
do we want to liberalise the markets
of course we do but subject to the same requirements and conditions for all producers both inside and outside the union
at the moment the european union is playing with the future of many farmers and stockbreeders in particular i must mention fragile sectors such as the sheep beef and tobacco sectors the survival of which in many producing areas will depend on this health check
some producers such as sheep producers are not asking for aid they simply want to be allowed to withdraw from the market with dignity because they have done their sums and the only way to survive is to reduce the volumes produced
the abandonment of production is therefore the only way out that we have left for many producers whose place will undoubtedly be taken by imports from third countries because consumers will not stop consuming and the world will not stop rapidly increasing the number of consumers
parliament should give a cautious opinion which the council must heed
i must thank the chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development mr parish for the steps he has taken to ensure that parliament is heard and not ignored as the council and the commission have so blatantly done to date
mr president firstly i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur mr capoulas santos on his magnificent work
i believe he has achieved balance and moderation in his report
at this stage in the debate i feel it is vital to send a message of stability to our farmers
more than ever european farmers need stability and solutions
they need long enough transitional periods as well as the continuation of specific measures for struggling sectors
commissioner the same solutions cannot be used for all sectors
you must remember that we have sectors that are experiencing real difficulties
the common agricultural policy must not be the problem but rather the solution and for that we need a strong first pillar
we believe and trust in rural development but we do not believe that the modulation proposed by the commission is the answer
rural development should not be strengthened to the detriment of the first pillar
we agree that the single payment scheme must be simplified by revising the market instruments
however this does not mean dismantling them
if we get this right we will be laying the foundations for a common agricultural policy continuing well beyond twenty thirteen if we get it wrong we will put many european farmers out of business
mr president this scheme has been long awaited by the fruit and vegetable sector not only because of the difficulties that it is facing but also because of the worrying decline in consumption
this scheme is intended to improve public health and i therefore believe it should be a european scheme with full community financing
i do not agree that parents should have to contribute to its funding because the same thing will happen as always those children whose parents can afford to contribute will eat fruit and vegetables in school whereas those who cannot will be left outside the scheme
this scheme must therefore be financed by the community so that it can be applied uniformly
i also particularly want to say that emphasis must be placed on educational measures
this scheme must not simply involve children eating apples rather they must know what type of apple they are eating and what its nutritional properties are and they must understand the beneficial effects of that fruit on their health and development
naturally the products must come with full quality guarantees with priority being given if possible to seasonal fruit also where possible i support the distribution of fruits and vegetables of community origin
i believe that the beneficial effects of this scheme which i applaud and on which i congratulate the commissioner will be seen immediately they will be seen not only in the present and future health of our children and their food education
food education but also and very importantly in the fruit and vegetable sector this is a productive sector which truly forms part of our european cultural heritage and which allows us to enjoy a balanced healthy and varied diet
i feel it is worthwhile trusting and investing in this scheme to distribute fruit and vegetables in our schools
in my opinion the budget is somewhat limited so i would repeat that i support full community financing of such an ambitious scheme
mr president i would ask that my initial words are not taken into account by the infernal time machine as
my initial words are not taken into account by the infernal time machine as they are intended to add to the message of condolence conveyed by this house to mrs klamt and in particular to congratulate the rapporteurs
i will now start
i congratulate the rapporteurs because with these two proposals we are taking a qualitative step towards a common immigration policy and we are promoting legal migration which is a key element of our global approach
the common set of rights and the single residence and work permit for legal migrants must be extended to the highest possible number of workers
as a result we socialists ask that no category of workers is excluded
the blue card offers an opportunity for migrants to settle with their families and work in our countries
it opens a single door to twenty seven labour markets
however it cannot be solely highly qualified workers who enter through this door
commissioner we therefore expect the commission to shortly present its proposals on other labour categories
ladies and gentlemen we must avoid a brain drain
this blue card must not become a passport encouraging vital human resources to leave developing countries
for every qualified professional who comes to europe the p s e group wants us to fund the training of a new professional in the country of origin
finally europe must be an attractive destination not only for talent coming from outside the union but also for our own european talent
in two thousand seven nearly three hundred thousand highly qualified europeans left to work outside the union
we must do everything we can to keep them in the european house
mrs wallström do you believe that the issue of whether electors feel close to or distant from candidates has an impact on the level of participation in european elections
do you agree with a state of forty five million inhabitants having only one electoral district for the european parliament elections
what can the commission do to ensure that states with a larger population have electoral districts which are closer to the people
please forgive me but i did not hear the commission vice president answer my questions
thank you very much madam vice president you have given me plenty of information on the issue that i raised and i thank you for this detailed information
i feel that the commission s new phase is important in particular the bamako project provides a focus for the european union in terms of immigration
i know that this has only just started so my question is probably premature but i wanted to ask the commission the following if this bamako project produces good results in terms of immigration does the commission believe that this experience can be extended to the other countries around the southern rim of the mediterranean
on behalf of mr yañez barnuevo i thank you for your answer however commissioner i must say to mr michel that his actions words and gestures are vital in the direct
vital in the direct contacts made with the cuban democratic opposition in terms of implementing the council s priority conclusions reducing the effects of castro s terrible dictatorship and encouraging freedom
mr president on behalf of the socialist group in the european parliament i want to express our total condemnation of the murders being committed in this region of somalia in the name of god
few atrocities have been committed by someone who has not invoked the name of god or a religion
i must particularly condemn the way in which this atrocious murder was committed a thirteen year old girl was raped she was then accused of adultery and then five men if we can call them men hurried to stone her to death even preventing someone from trying to save her in a stadium with around one thousand spectators
this event combined with the acts of piracy which so far this year have involved almost one hundred boats being hijacked along the coast of somalia constitutes a wholly unacceptable humanitarian situation
the international community cannot remain impassive
it must not remain impassive in the face of cowardice and the use of religion to justify the commission of atrocities
we therefore have to re establish order by supporting the legitimate government of somalia so that it can take back control of the whole country and establish a rule of law which respects human rights
i believe that there have been few occasions when we have been presented with such a clear situation which requires us to act
i believe that we cannot remain impassive here in this community of five hundred million people and twenty seven countries the most important in the world
we must intervene i do not know how we can do this but i believe that we must and quickly
the socialist group does not agree with the amendments tabled at the last moment which have not been duly negotiated
we support the text of the joint motion for a resolution and hope that this will mark the start of the european union s serious concern about this type of humanitarian issue and its condemnation of the misuse of religious concepts to commit atrocities in the name of god
i think the rapporteur and the previous speakers have highlighted the main features of this proposal for a european parliament and council directive
it deals with the recognition that arms and munitions also come under the internal market though subject of course to a number of restrictions
these are not normal goods they are not sweets or leisure goods but objects that need to be carefully controlled
there are of course restrictions in the treaty itself in articles thirty and two hundred ninety six which give the member states significant responsibilities in this area
the fact that we have a common market does not stop the member states from being obliged to comply with safety standards and having the right to enforce them when their own safety is threatened
the work that was carried out in the committee on legal affairs and the committees issuing opinions that collaborated with it with the agreement of the council under the expert management of the rapporteur mrs rühle was highly positive
in my view the text that we are presenting today is well balanced
basically although a large number of amendments appear on paper today we are confining ourselves to just one amendment sixty three which is the one that sums up the spirit of the compromise the content and wording of this amendment are consistent and will enable this whole market to operate effectively
mr toubon has pointed out that this is in relation to other international texts
these include the adoption or rather the signing this month of the oslo convention banning cluster munitions as well as the convention restricting anti personnel mines and a whole series of international agreements and even european union legislation designed to restrict the use of weapons
i believe our model is not one of free movement of arms at any time but a regulated market controlled both by the member states and from now on by the e u institutions themselves
madam president commissioner this proposal was issued by the commission more than a year ago with some really ambitious objectives
in the meantime there have been financial upheavals around the world that it seemed would sink these measures in the end however a balanced agreement has been reached it satisfies hardly
satisfies hardly anyone in its entirety but it is a good agreement that retains the final objectives and at the same time gives businesses better access to the means to achieve them
that is why we must offer our very special thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur mrs doyle to the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups and also very especially to the french presidency because its work has enabled us to achieve a good outcome for everyone
i trust that circumstances in the near future will enable us to be much more ambitious and that other countries will also join this crusade to fight climate change that we are all so keen to carry out in europe
mr president commissioner this was a good proposal in the form in which it came from the commission not only because of the sulphur reductions but also because of its new article sevena which demanded a gradual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from suppliers
sevena which demanded a gradual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from suppliers and because it resolved the old vapour pressure problem for petrol bioethanol mixtures in countries such as mine that have hot summers
this was filtered out in the vote in the committee on the environment public health and food safety to the concern of many of us
today we have an agreement on the table which softens the application of article sevena and restores the vapour pressure waiver while of course toughening the conditions for making use of the
as with the rest of the climate change package not everyone will find it wholly satisfactory but it is something that everyone can accept
i would like to thank mrs corbey for her excellent work and her receptiveness in solving problems and i would also like to thank mr turmes and of course the french presidency which has shown itself to be highly effective in this area as well
as the report says according to two thousand seven estimates zimbabwe has a population of twelve million and almost half of them are starving
life expectancy is thirty six years only forty percent of the country s teachers are working and only one third of students attend classes this shows that mr mugabe is not only killing the present he is killing the future
repression and the trampling of human rights are also part of the daily agenda
people who uphold human rights in zimbabwe have been systematically targeted with arbitrary detention arrest and torture
government legislation has severely curtailed the freedoms of expression assembly movement and association
i would like to mention a few examples since the government has introduced increasingly repressive laws that have been used against these activists defending human rights
include the access to information and protection of privacy act used by the government to effectively silence journalists the public order and security act which has severely curtailed the freedom of assembly and hundreds of
defenders of human rights including workers of independent means have been arbitrarily detained and the private voluntary organisations act brought back by the government in two thousand two and presumably used to intimidate and harass ngos
madam president in my mother tongue euskera basque which is not official in this house mugabe means without limit ' a good motto for this individual
the dictator of this african country is not just one more name on the long list of dictators that we have had the misfortune to have on this planet but i would dare say he is up there among the top ten dictators
in my opinion we in the e u have to do our utmost for this individual to step down and end his days facing a court of human rights
we therefore wish zimbabwe a happy two thousand nine without mugabe
we have a motion for a resolution on nicaragua in which we have to take a number of factors into account
first of all there are allegations of fraud in the two municipalities of nicaragua and león at least and that tarnishes the outcome of the election on nine november
on the other hand we have a government that has tried to resolve some of the problems that take away human rights in latin america
namely poverty illiteracy infant mortality availability of drinking water and lack of title to indigenous lands
when we examine the case therefore we must make a clear distinction between these two aspects
on one hand we must boost human rights and uphold human rights in their traditional sense as political rights whereas on the other we must encourage the nicaraguan government to continue helping the most deprived sectors in the country
we must also of course ensure that the opposition can fulfil its role we must take a stand against fraud and we must endorse the work of ngos
nonetheless there must be a balanced outcome
the socialist group in the european parliament has tabled a number of proposals for oral amendments in an attempt to channel the final text into a more balanced
form with regard to the allegations of violations of fundamental rights whether or not criminal investigations should be launched and the number of municipalities in which some kind of irregularity has actually happened
in short we want to condemn the alleged infringements of fundamental political rights but without going to the extreme of placing the government of nicaragua in a difficult situation so that it can go on performing its role of supporting the most deprived strata of its society
today we are debating the situation that has been created in nicaragua by the attacks on some defenders of human rights on certain fundamental freedoms and on democracy
i do not have to remind you here of zoilamérica or ernesto cardenal or carlos mejía godoy or jarquín or sergio ramírez or so many other nicaraguans who now feel their hopes for a better nicaragua have been betrayed
in november two thousand six mr ortega asked the nicaraguans for what he called a new opportunity and they democratically gave it to him
we now know what he wanted it for
since then arbitrariness nepotism and corruption have taken hold in the institutions of government culminating in the electoral fraud of the nine november ballot
prior to that some very serious decisions had been made such as annulling the legal status of some opposition parties or threats and intimidation directed at members of civil society journalists and the media
president ortega likened the governments of the european union to flies landing in filth and considered the foreign aid that nicaragua received mere crumbs
he soon realised that there was not enough venezuelan oil for him to do without that development aid
when we are prepared to enter a decisive phase in the negotiation of an association agreement between the european union and central america the nicaraguan government must understand that it will always find an ally and a friend in us
us but that respect for human rights freedom of expression and democracy is for us in short a condition that we shall never waive because we believe that it is above all the people of nicaragua who benefit from it
municipal elections were held in nicaragua on nine november this year
as on previous occasions the electoral process has been called into question in terms of its democratic legitimacy accusations of fraud have been made and demonstrations have taken place
and demonstrations have taken place with clashes between supporters of different political parties many people have been injured and the political crisis in which the country is immersed is getting deeper
two political parties were unable to put up candidates for the local elections that is unacceptable because it curtails the fundamental right of all citizens to political participation
moreover we have received direct statements from representatives of human rights organisations telling us about the mood in civil society to question the judicial system about the
about the administrative repression mechanisms that have brought up to seventeen social movement organisations before the courts and about the persecution of independent journalists and even the delegation from the european commission
for all these reasons we must raise our voices and call firstly on the political parties to condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by their followers and secondly on the government itself to reopen spaces for democratic participation
to respect freedom of expression to stop banning marches and to allow all ngos to receive international cooperation aid and not only aid from venezuela for pro government associations
in addition they should revoke the criminalisation of therapeutic abortion in cases where the mother s life is threatened
finally in the context of the negotiations on the association agreement between central america and the e u we call on the commission to remind nicaragua that it must respect the principles of the rule of law democracy
democracy and human rights that however must not prevent europe from continuing to provide aid for the development and welfare of the nicaraguan people because we want them to have the best possible future
madam president i would like to make reference to the breyer report
it must be said that european farmers are fully aware that particular attention must be paid to human health and to the protection of the environment when using plant protection products
however the industry is deeply concerned because the european parliament does not understand the impact that this regulation may have in the future
assessments of its potential impact indicate that due to the unavailability of plant protection products in the future it is going to be very difficult
control pests and diseases that affect the cultivation of many foods specifically all mediterranean produce as well as the cultivation of ornamental plants and cut flowers
i am fully aware that the agreement adopted in the trialogue was the result of hard negotiation and i therefore have to acknowledge the work the rapporteurs have done
nevertheless it must be recognised that the temporary definition of endocrine disrupters will result in the disappearance of a large number of active substances particularly insecticides which are of utmost importance to farming
the producers must have at their disposal a sufficient quantity of active substances in order to effectively and safely combat any disease or pest affecting their plants bearing in mind that often the danger lies not in the product itself but in its misuse
for these reasons the spanish delegation of the group of the european people s party and european democrats supports the proposals requesting an impact assessment and will vote in favour of mr sturdy s amendments
mr sturdy s amendments which i have signed myself relating to endocrine disrupters and those in support of plant protection products being made available in an emergency
furthermore if this regulation is adopted in the terms of the agreement reached the outcome will be a reduction in food production and a rise in prices which will result in our importing those same foods that we do not produce treated with the very products we are banning
mr president mr cappato your report is full of good intentions the clearest proof of which is that no amendments were deemed to be necessary by the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs
you were the one who introduced eighteen amendments to your own report
it is those amendments that have given the report a radical edge to put it in general terms and that have raised very serious doubts for me
i would divide into four distinct groups the amendments that you have proposed amendments that you have proposed to yourself i would stress in a report that received the support of all groups initially
firstly some are impossible you make some suggestions that are impossible
for example mr cappato some of your suggestions have no legal basis as yet until the lisbon treaty enters into force it will be impossible to harmonise the rules of the different institutions
commissioner wallström has just said something similar you also call for two thousand nine to be declared european year of transparency but we are too late there is no time
some of your suggestions are therefore impossible
secondly some of your suggestions are inadvisable
for example you call for transparency in the meetings of the political groups
this would not do
there is a need for privacy since privacy is a political asset
if i want to disagree with my party and to maintain my opposition i want to do so in private that is not a lack of transparency
there must be transparency within public bodies but not within the parties the privacy of whose debates must be guaranteed
i cannot therefore agree with you on this point
some of your other assertions mr cappato are incorrect
for example you state that ninety percent of legislative activity is done through comitology
this is a bold exaggeration mr cappato
furthermore comitology has its own implicit transparency standards
if we introduce more mechanisms more bureaucracy and more controls we will be going against what we want to achieve transparency which is closely linked to simplicity
lastly before the president signals to me because i am already nearing the end of my time some of your suggestions are unnecessary
for example i understand that it is really wonderful and attractive to public opinion to speak of transparency in members activities so that it can be seen whether they attend plenary sittings
it can already be seen mr cappato
it can also be seen whether they attend the committees too there are minutes for each of them to which all citizens have access
the allowances that meps claim are also public
in other words it is perfectly possible for citizens to gain access to this information
i therefore understand that it is wonderful in terms of public opinion and it looks good to defend transparency but you must realise that transparency means ensuring that things are seen as they really are and that if we contribute to distorting how things are seen mr cappato we are not contributing to transparency
thank you for your generosity mr president
mr president the spanish members of the socialist group in the european parliament view the situation in gaza with horror pain and shame but also with a commitment to defend peace protect those who are suffering most and maintain dignity and hope
our horror is at the repeated scenes of murdered children and women heartbroken in their endless suffering following the bombing of the ghetto that gaza has become
picasso depicted this same horror in his painting of our guernica razed to the ground by the junkers of the condor legion seven decades ago
our pain is at the enormous suffering of so many victims
our shame is at the inability of everyone our countries the european union and the international community to firstly prevent and secondly end the criminal aggression which we condemn
our shame and also indignation are at so many lies so much ambiguity and so much hot air
our shame is because we know exactly what is happening yet we are not acting with the necessary forcefulness and coherence
history will therefore demand an explanation from many as accessories to the crime at the very least due to their failures
is always better late than never and as it is vital to keep open a door to hope the european union must support the belated security council resolution however it
ensure that this is strictly observed just as our association agreement with israel must also be strictly observed which provides for its suspension in the event of behaviour such as that which is occurring
incidentally is hamas also responsible for the media blackout that i have not yet heard anyone condemn
mr president we must tell israel with absolute conviction to stop killing and to allow the wounded to be treated and the victims to be fed it must be told that its attitude towards international law will have consequences for its relations with europe
i want to congratulate the few young european voluntary workers who are suffering together with the people of gaza in particular alberto arce
they represent the best of the values of solidarity and freedom held by this europe of ours which needs to act accordingly in such a terrible conflict
madam president commissioner as we have recently witnessed the textile sector is suffering a major crisis that has led to many closures relocations and redundancies particularly in regions that specialise in this industry
in view of the current economic crisis the european commission should act as quickly as possible in conjunction with the member states to alleviate the socioeconomic effects of this restructuring these changes have been particularly dramatic for the regions and families affected
i think that workers in the textile and clothing sector should be given assistance and that social measures should be drawn up in the form of plans to help companies that are undergoing restructuring and currently find themselves in very difficult circumstances
it would be desirable to direct a substantial part of the european globalisation adjustment fund to restructuring and retraining in the textile sector in
particular for the small and medium sized enterprises that make up the majority of the sector in the european union the smes have suffered significantly from the effects of the liberalisation of the market
furthermore the import control system should be re established in particular with reference to chinese imports due to their volume
this is not at all a matter of promoting trade barriers
it is more a matter of compensating for the negative effects of this significant change we should not forget that the european union is the second largest exporter in the world of textile products and
in the world of textile products and clothing which makes it necessary to guarantee optimum access to the markets of third countries this is essential to the future of the textile and clothing industry in the european union and in particular for smes
all of this of course must be carried out while guaranteeing fair competition on the basis of the promotion of social and environmental standards in these countries
in this regard the provision of accurate information for consumers for example the regulation imposing made in labelling which we know has not been implemented would be of great use given that
it would mean that imported products would be subject to the same consumer safety and protection requirements as those manufactured within the european union
mr romeva do not be concerned the spanish government will cooperate as it always has done
may i remind you that on this matter the spanish minister for foreign affairs miguel ángel moratinos was the first to appear before the investigating committee and was the one who answered all the questions including your own
in this parliament we have for some time denounced the torture and inhumane humiliating treatment being used at the guantánamo military base in the name of the fight against international terrorism
we therefore welcome president obama s decision to suspend trials for four months and his intention to close the prison permanently within one year
however even though the responsibility lies with the u s government the european union cannot look the other way but should offer its assistance in order to guarantee closure of the detention centre
we should also assess the possibility of taking in prisoners who are from countries where it is not certain that human rights are respected if the united states should ask us to do so
we will then have to present a common european response of which the spanish government will be part whilst respecting the international legal framework and assessing case by case the legal situation of every citizen every detainee his origin his detention and his situation
mr president in the e u there are several cases of languages spoken by historical european groups which cannot be used in debates in this parliament since they are not recognised as state languages this is a loss to representative democracy
one of these cases is the basque language euskera which is not a minority language but an official one at least in the southern area of the basque country which in administrative terms is classed as part of the spanish state
however the same is not true and please do not take this personally commissioner in the northern part of the basque country which is attached to the french state whose president stated to the united nations assembly that to deny respect for national identities and languages is to sow the seeds of humiliation and that without that respect there will not be peace in the world
for all that neither euskera nor corsican breton or occitan are given the slightest official consideration nor are they given support to ensure their use is respected and encouraged
that is why i ask the agency for fundamental rights to keep watch and to work to ensure that within member states there is no violation of any european people s right to use its mother tongue and no discrimination against its citizens and that all native languages are considered official within their respective territories

madam president firstly i would like to thank our rapporteur claudio fava for his hard work in reaching a common position with the council the result includes many improvements suggested by our parliament
with this directive once again we are showing our commitment to developing a common migration policy based on a global approach
the aim of this directive is clear to fight against mafia groups to penalise unscrupulous employers and to protect exploited immigrants who have no form of social protection
we want to see the disappearance of starvation wages which are unfair on immigrants and what is more distort average wages particularly in sectors such as construction agriculture domestic services and the hotel industry
these measures require a great deal of courage and political will for there are many vested interests and a lot of money circulating in the informal economy
particularly in difficult times it is more important than ever that we manage migration flows intelligently and generously but responsibly
it would be easy to succumb to the temptation of not trying to keep the informal economy in check
we cannot look the other way and leave some eight million illegal immigrants defenceless against working conditions bordering on slavery
ladies and gentlemen if we want this directive to be effective there need to be rigorous inspections and economic sanctions including criminal sanctions in the most serious cases which will act as a deterrent to employers
we will thus succeed in shrinking the informal economy market and putting an end to the incentive to migrate that arises from the possibility of working illegally
it must be made clear that working legally is the only way to work in europe
for this reason we want to move forward with a global approach and commissioner mr barrot we call on the commission to introduce the new blue cards for all other employment categories as soon as possible
commissioner mr solana ladies and gentlemen i would firstly like to thank the three rapporteurs for their work as a shadow rapporteur for the report on the common foreign and security policy i will refer
will refer specifically to that document beginning by congratulating mr saryusz wolski on the results of his work and his collaboration with other groups in order to obtain a consensual result
in the same way as parliament has demanded many times that the european union be provided with the tools necessary to give it a single voice in the world this house itself is also able to present a united front when evaluating and giving impetus to the great priorities of common foreign and security policy
the efforts of our group the socialist group in the european parliament have been towards twin goals first introducing or reinforcing the big issues that we believe to be instrumental across all areas of foreign policy such as the fight against climate change the promotion of peace across the globe or a commitment to human development second
peace across the globe or a commitment to human development second proposing ways to restore the balance between the geographical priorities of the c f s p as they appeared originally in the text if they did appear or introducing them as a new element if they were absent
that is why we have championed for example greater clarification of the actions between the institutional and cooperative frameworks involved in the recently defined eastern dimension
we have argued for greater diversification of and greater emphasis to be placed on relationships with africa a continent that we often only remember when particularly violent wars break out and much of the time not even then
as regards latin america we wanted the current negotiation processes for association agreements the first bi regional talks that the european union will conclude in its history to be given consideration
concerning the mediterranean we have objected to a reductionist approximation that only talks about security instead we want to include the rich political economic and socio cultural heritage contained in the barcelona process
as far as amendments for plenary are concerned our group has not presented any because we believe that in that way the balance achieved by the compromises is somehow strengthened we will therefore oppose the majority of amendments so as not to damage the compromise reached in the committee on foreign affairs
mr president the referendum in venezuela has ended in a victory for the yes campaign which has been graciously acknowledged by the democratic opposition
it is also true that there has not been equality of opportunities during the campaign and that the ruling party has had the overwhelming support of the entire state apparatus while the opposition has suffered constant harassment and coercion
even under these conditions the country has been practically split down the middle and it will be very difficult to build a future with just one of these groups
the european union must promote dialogue inclusion and consensus between the venezuelan political and social leaders for the good of the country
visceral attitudes condemnation and insults will not be the way to help venezuela to find the way onto a democratic pluralist and free pathway
we therefore criticise the decision of the venezuelan government to expel a spanish member and especially the way in which this was done however we urge this house to prevent
our representatives when visiting third countries from making statements that violate current local legislation and especially that insult a head of state however worthy of criticism he might be
such attitudes are compromising future european parliament missions to other countries
mr president i have just come back from venezuela where i was invited by its electoral authority as a member of an international electoral support group for the referendum on fifteen february
the european members of the group have submitted a report to the national electoral council with a positive overall evaluation of the process in terms of its organisation transparency participation freedom and secrecy of voting and security in all its phases
regarding the statements that mr herrero made on venezuelan television i can tell you that they served to delegitimise the electoral process made serious accusations against democratic institutions in that country and bordered on interference in the internal politics of a sovereign country
parliament should not encourage any type of confrontation with the democratic institutions in venezuela
however it is up to mr herrero himself to give explanations to the house for an action that affects us all
mr president the committee on budgets believes that it is of the utmost importance that each of the budgetary instruments be clearly demarcated
therefore the most realistic option seems to be the creation of a new instrument for actions other than public development aid for countries falling under the regulation
from a budgetary point of view the financing proposal from the committee on development does not appear to be adequate as this money does not exist
not exist and these lines do not have funds allocated on a multiannual basis there is funding for two thousand nine but not beyond that
in any case given that the financing of this new cooperation instrument must be compatible with the two thousand seven twenty thirteen financial framework it is worth
pointing out the importance of the mid term review of the financial framework this should allow an adjustment of the different headings ceilings
madam president at this late hour on a monday the commission will probably have other things on its mind more worrying than this report
to be brief what we are doing is simply responding to a report by the commission which is a report on the application of council regulation no twelve oh six two thousand one
council regulation no twelve oh six two thousand one of twenty eight may two thousand one on cooperation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters
this sphere is in fact not a community one but an intergovernmental one in which the council through the regulation has tried to encourage cooperation between the courts
i believe however that there has been a certain lack of rigour on the european union s part in its attempts to achieve this
that is to say certain measures have been taken such as the formulation of practical ideas the use of electronic media and so on but i recognise that it is quite difficult for the commission to act
i do not know what the commission has achieved or what it hopes to achieve but it seems to me quite difficult to achieve anything because of the huge difficulties involved in this form of intergovernmental cooperation
what we are asking is for the judicial authorities to collaborate but we are talking about twenty seven countries judicial authorities that use twenty two different languages with legal systems that have significant differences between them and we are trying to achieve results
the commission has found that the results are not good that there is a huge delay in the implementation of these cooperation mechanisms and therefore that we do not have the resources to achieve this
the ideal solution would be to use physical means
for example what could the commission do to equip courts particularly those at a lower level with technological facilities such as videoconferencing systems
videoconferencing might be an idea that seems out of reach in many small courts within the european union but it appears to be the only way of achieving this
i think the european union ought to make use of institutions that already exist and specifically the european judicial network
we should strengthen this institution so that the judges themselves using their cooperation systems can develop this type of communication
on the other hand the whole area of training judges is vital
this too is something that the commission cannot do by itself
what the commission can do however is to foster the development of courses of this type providing training in community law and in the knowledge of the various legal systems
aside from this there is another huge difficulty which is the problem of languages how can a spanish judge for instance communicate with a finnish judge when the two languages are so different
it cannot be argued that the judges as well as having to be experts in their own law which is fairly complex in itself should be obliged to have knowledge of this kind
what can we do from the practical point of view to help the judges with regard to interpreting and translation
what could we do to help them to achieve this
in drawing up this report i am not setting out to take a severe or harsh approach towards the commission
i think the task is quite a difficult one
what i would like to know taking advantage of the fact that we have here a commissioner who is interested in this subject is what the commission thinks can be done to give greater
rigour to this two thousand one regulation which was a little vague a little too much based on voluntary action i do not know whether from the practical point of view it can produce any results or whether it will be possible to make progress with it
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i am delighted that we can end the current parliamentary term with the final adoption of the last of the maritime packages
i remember however that when i first came to the european parliament in nineteen ninety nine we had a serious maritime accident off the french coast with the which gave its name to the first set of legislative proposals designed to avert and prevent accidents
we thought we had warded off the danger but soon afterwards the coastline of galicia was ruined by the tar from an even worse accident than the previous one the
since then we in the committee on transport and tourism have worked on a succession of legislative packages in an attempt to overcome the excessive resistance we have encountered among shipowners oil companies classification societies and also certain member states which rejected the three proposals for being too stringent
over the last ten years we have adopted a number of directives and regulations some of which we have had to go back and revise because they proved ineffective in their initial versions as a result of the cuts made by the council
adopted legislation to introduce double hulled vessels a european fund for major oil disasters and ports of refuge and now we are revising and adopting legislation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea the investigation
on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea the investigation of maritime accidents the community vessel traffic monitoring and information system port state control and lastly the regulation and directives on ship inspection and survey organisations
all this is good and it is desirable that it should enter into force and be implemented by all the member states as soon as possible
i am pleased at that
however this parliament s term is coming to an end i am leaving parliament and i am going with the regret that we have not succeeded in making it compulsory to introduce control systems which already exist and
to introduce control systems which already exist and have been patented to show when and what amounts of bilge and oil tank residues have been illegally dumped into the sea by a particular vessel
in other words they are a kind of black box or tachometer that can be inspected by the maritime authorities whenever a vessel enters port
i believe we owe the marine environment greater attention and stricter procedures to avert all the pollution we cause i also think that if we fail in this it will affect our food chain and our lives and we will end up paying a high price for it
i trust it will not take another ten years to control illegal discharges at sea more effectively and efficiently
mr president the revision of the eurovignette directive is a very important issue that occupies us all and is also a cause for concern particularly to those of us in peripheral countries who feel victimised by this proposal
the european commission has decided to approach the internalisation of the external costs of road transport by charging for three new costs air pollution noise pollution and congestion
although the principles behind the proposal the user pays and the polluter pays are reasonable the solution proposed is definitely not as it will discriminate against a sector which for months has been suffering from the disastrous effects of the economic crisis
although it was not the intention to demonise goods transport by road it has ended up being the target
this proposal ladies and gentlemen is inappropriate and far from achieving the expected objectives of sustainable transport it will be a death sentence for a large number of small and medium sized european enterprises that employ thousands of
people in the european union and contribute every day to the distribution of goods ensuring that products reach the end consumer consumers will see how product prices will rise when these charges are implemented
ladies and gentlemen we need a transport system that is competitive sustainable and environmentally friendly and does not rule out road transport because at the moment it is the only way to get everywhere
modal change remains a dream and is far from becoming reality
trans european networks motorways of the sea and cross border connections are still plans and not realities in some cases
when the world economy goes down ladies and gentlemen we cannot ask the orchestra to carry on playing and certainly not in celebration
mr president on fifteen july two thousand eight the european commission adopted a communication to the council and parliament recommending that a strategic partnership be established between the european union and mexico
for its part on thirteen october two thousand eight the european general affairs and external relations council recognised mexico as a strategic partner pending parliament s opinion on the matter
i would recall that at the seventh meeting of the eu mexico joint parliamentary committee held at the end of october last year we said that a
strategic partnership between mexico and the european union would provide the impetus needed to strengthen and develop the true potential of our bilateral relations
this is a good time in the relations between the two sides and the results of the current global agreement are good
we stress the need for our respective executive powers to strengthen collaboration in the political economic and cooperation spheres particularly in view of the new challenges of all kinds resulting from the financial and economic crisis that is causing havoc in our continents
mexico is a great country with which we share values and goals such as the development of democratic forms of government a commitment to gender equality consolidation of the rule of law fair and sustainable development and respect for human rights
we advocate closer cooperation in the fight against organised crime terrorism and drug trafficking based on the principles of shared responsibility and strict adherence to international law
consequently we shall support the proposal for a recommendation on the eu mexico strategic partnership to be put before parliament this morning
madam president with regard to the report on micro credits i want to congratulate all the rapporteurs because they have done some great work
they have undoubtedly improved the commission s initiative
i believe that the recommendations made in this report will enable us to establish the basis for developing a proper framework in the european union for the micro credit sector
has been successful in many developing countries including in some european countries both as a means of generating economic activity and as a tool for increasing social inclusion and promoting job creation
however this success has not to date been transferred to the community context i believe that we now have the opportunity to do so particularly given the economic and financial crisis that we are facing
in this respect strengthening the initiatives put forward in this report must be a priority but we must also take other steps
we must increase the funds available for these micro credit support structures
we must ensure easier access for those individuals and businesses that cannot access loans in this respect madam president i want to highlight the example of
the european guarantee for micro loans as this is a tool that could improve this access and that has been included in the report
i will end by saying that this report will undoubtedly lay the foundations so that we can create a harmonious framework in the european context in order to encourage the micro credit sector
madam president taking advantage of the fact that we are talking about the budget i think that we should prepare ourselves for negotiating a continuation of support for coal next year it is a vital domestic source of energy
i am saying this with an appropriate amount of advance warning because some high up official improperly allowed himself to express his opinion to the contrary leaking it to an economics publication this has confused public opinion
this is by no means the case
after twenty twelve we will have to continue to support coal from my country and i would like the report of parliamentary proceedings to state that fact
officials please restrict yourselves to implementing the plan in force and then from twenty twelve the instrument which we will begin to negotiate with the sector next year
mr president commissioner this question as explained by mr blokland is very timely given the diplomatic conference on the convention for the recycling of ships to be held in may
i would therefore like to congratulate mr blokland not only on the question but also on the resolution that he has drawn up
in the we are in favour of combating the bad practices and methods in use in relation to the scrapping of ships and we therefore support mr blokland s motion for a resolution there are however certain points that worry us
the first is paragraph three to which mr blokland himself has also already referred which states that ships should be considered in their entirety as hazardous waste and should therefore fall within the scope of the basel convention
we have tabled an amendment on this paragraph because there are differing interpretations both within and outside and european union and we believe that the basel convention should be taken into account and that there should be no conflict with it it ought to be the future international agreement on the scrapping of ships however that defines the details of its application
paragraph fourteen of the motion for a resolution also calls for a funding mechanism that is based on mandatory contributions from the maritime transport sector
it really seems to us a little premature to be talking at the moment about mandatory contributions when there has so far been no decision within the international maritime organization as to what the system is to be that is to be adopted through this funding and it seems to me that the european commission does not have a clear response on this subject either
finally in paragraph fifteen there is a call for the commission to establish clearly that the state with jurisdiction over waste is the responsible state
we do not believe that this is a matter for the commission to decide on the contrary we think that this ought also to be decided in an international agreement
what is important is to safeguard consistency between the future agreement on the recycling of ships and the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal while taking into account not only the basel convention but also all the existing legislation
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the first thing i would like to do is to congratulate the rapporteur with whom we have very similar views as regards this programme and secondly to congratulate everyone involved because in such a time of economic crisis it is fundamental to maintain a programme like this with obvious positive social effects
although we are only involved in a consultation procedure we must send out a clear political message from the european parliament at this time of economic uncertainty we must send a message from brussels and strasbourg that we are not only or exclusively
a message from brussels and strasbourg that we are not only or exclusively concerned with the recovery of the financial system but that we are also fully aware of the need to develop our social policies especially those which support the people most in need the poorest in the european union
we agree with the commission that this food distribution programme should continue to be considered part of the common agricultural policy for several reasons because european agriculture has a marked social dimension because this programme is a tool that works because now we need it more than ever and because it has to continue operating
we in the socialist group in the european parliament like the rapporteur are against this programme being cofinanced by the european union and its member states since that would mean discrimination between states according to their wealth which could then lead to a situation whereby the programme could not be put into practice in the most disadvantaged countries
it is difficult to comprehend why at a time when it is most needed the commission wants to save community money from the caps most social facet especially since there is a budgetary surplus every year in the agricultural budget
full community funding is fundamental for us
we need to ensure that this programme will reach out to all countries and especially those most in need
the forty three million potential beneficiaries of this programme require that we make a huge effort and do not avoid budgetary expenditure under any circumstances
austerity yes but not where the poorest people are concerned
this programme must cover the whole trajectory of the food distributed to ensure that it reaches citizens in all the member states
in order to achieve this goal we in the socialist group for which i am the shadow rapporteur have brought forward an amendment proposing that all expenditure arising from distribution storage and administration be defrayed from community finances
we also agree with the rapporteur that the food should be of high quality and preferably sourced from the community
this approach is in keeping with this parliament s position on other similar programmes which we were recently discussing in the house such as the plan to hand out fruit in the schools
many thanks that is all
we hope that the commission will take into account the parliament s position when it votes and above all we hope that it will put this plan into action within the union as soon as possible
the arctic region is one of the most fragile on our planet
the consequences of unrestricted exploitation of its natural resources would be catastrophic not only for the surrounding area and the indigenous population but for the world as a whole
the thawing of large areas has made those risks a reality creating the need for a new global regulation to protect the arctic similar to the existing one for the antarctic while bearing in mind the differences that have already been highlighted in the debate
we need an international treaty between all parties involved which no doubt includes the european union in order to protect the unique arctic environment to ensure the full sustainability of all kinds of human activity and to implement multilateral regulation of shipping in new sea lanes that become accessible
in the years since it was created the arctic council has been a model of cooperation in managing shared problems
in these times of difficulty or uncertainty we should take that spirit and understanding to a higher level so as to avoid neighbouring states or other international players becoming involved in geostrategic arguments and forgetting what should be our common goal preserving a great shared heritage
mr president unlike the two previous speakers i am in agreement with the majority of the members who have spoken on this point
this is a good directive in fact an excellent directive which is designed to protect performing artists
when there is talk of having to find a more intelligent way of doing deals what is actually being discussed is doing away with the concept of intellectual property
deals can only be done if there is an established law
we already have an established law at the national level
the commission under the leadership of mr mccreevy has adopted a fine initiative a positive initiative and i believe that the house should adopt the agreement that we have
have reached within the committee on legal affairs thanks to the work done by the rapporteur mr crowley and the various shadow rapporteurs such as mrs gill and mr toubon
i believe this is a magnificent directive and that it will strengthen the creation of intellectual property
in addition the directive includes several recommendations regarding further work to be done
i believe that the adoption of the report by this house and i hope that the council will align itself with the commission and parliament will serve to ensure that in the next term of office the
commission will continue along this road will make proposals to parliament and that we will make progress within the framework of the protection of intellectual property which is vital for the development of our european union as a great institution based on a common culture
mr president the information that you are giving us is correct but we as members of this house and most definitely the citizens of europe get the impression that there is a very dangerous gap in community law
at present whilst tax demands continue to be intensified in every one of the member states mobility is almost impossible
when we ask the commission to explain this pragmatic approach it seems that the commission does not have any support in the council
we seem to find ourselves in a vicious circle in which the commission refers us to the council and the council refers us back to the commission but meanwhile the reality is that the citizens of this europe that we are trying to build do not have the option to reside in different countries or to establish relationships due to the heavy tax burden caused by the lack of harmonisation in the fiscal system
could the council do something to put an end to this vicious circle
madam president for once i am glad that i am not the incumbent glad that mr tajani has come because mr tajani has the advantage of having been an m e p
i know that as a former member of this house you have experienced the frustration that we have as meps regarding the application of community law
well in parliament we do have a tendency to take the commission to task but i think that we are setting the commission an impossible brief because all community law and all application of community law is based on indirect application
in other words the commission has only a few officials in the central headquarters where it receives some complaints and has some options for action but at the moment the trend is to restrict budgetary powers and so the commission is not going to be able to act
all community law and all application of community law is based on action by the national authorities national parliaments national courts and national civil servants
here on this aspect i do not believe that we can demand too much from the commission
what we should do is to help the commission and i think that the report by mrs frassoni contains several points that may be useful in trying to make the application of community law a reality
i am referring to the points on the correlation of national measures with directives the cooperation of national parliaments and action by national courts
mr president two years ago i had the opportunity as part of a mission headed by mrs isler béguin my colleague who is in the chamber here to visit
in the chamber here to visit sierra leone to attend the special court and to become aware of the huge task that it was accomplishing not only for sierra leona but also for mankind as a whole
the special court for sierra leone has of course set a precedent as has already been mentioned here
it has set a precedent in that as the resolution states it is the first international court to be funded by voluntary contributions the first to be established in the country where the alleged crimes took place and it was also the first court as has already been pointed out to indict a former head of state
for all these reasons not only because it constitutes a precedent but also because it is a benchmark for other courts that have been created and modelled along the same lines such as the courts of rwanda the former yugoslavia cambodia or lebanon we consider it vital that this resolution on which we have now been working together with the court for several months be adopted
two years ago we adopted a resolution to support its funding since at that time the special court was going through a difficult period was without any
funds and did not have the necessary support and here we should thank the european commission too which gave the court its financial support
now we are asking above all for two things firstly that those who have been convicted should serve their sentences what is at stake here is not the operation of the special court which will conclude its work next year but the legacy that it is to leave us and secondly obviously that all this should be accompanied by more funding
in short the special court for sierra leone is a fine example and a benchmark for all of us and for all courts that have dealt with war crimes
it is a fine example and a benchmark and it is a lesson being given to us by the second poorest country on the planet as we entered the court we saw the slogan no peace without justice '
that is exactly why we have a moral obligation not only as europeans but as human beings to ensure that the legacy of this special court leaves its mark on history
mr president i shall speak very briefly for which the honourable members will be grateful at this time of night mr tajani many thanks once again because you have shown as you did in the third maritime package
maritime package that your impetus and political skill have brought about an agreement with the council and made it possible for parliament the council and the commission to come to an agreement on this occasion and in the final days of this parliamentary term
i believe that we should congratulate ourselves
i am of course grateful to the draftsmen of the opinions both from the committee on legal affairs and the committee on the environment public health and food safety for their close collaboration
i reiterate my thanks for the shadow rapporteurs hard work and collaboration i am certain that tomorrow s adoption of an agreement at first reading on such an important regulation that is sure to complete the work of the
third maritime package is a success for this parliament and for the three institutions of the european union once again it justifies the useful codecision procedure which enables us to hold a constructive dialogue to the benefit of all the citizens of the european union
mr president as i missed one minute of time earlier i would like to respond to commissioner kuneva who is aware of the feeling of friendship and affection i have for her and indeed for mr orban
but the commissioner has failed to make a single mention of the ombudsman s recommendation
in other words the ombudsman who is aware of all the commissioner s arguments has made a specific recommendation of which the commission appears to be ignoring every aspect
i am not even asking mrs kuneva to give me an answer personally because obviously she is not the one with the information but all the information she has given me is in line with what we already knew and with what the ombudsman knows and yet she still has not told us whether
the commission regardless of all that and knowing that the ombudsman who is familiar with the case is recommending that the rule be changed is going to act on the ombudsman s request and parliament s related recommendation
mr president i believe that the proposals for regulations that have been submitted to us by the commission are important and necessary and on the other hand it was also important and necessary for
in the european parliament to insist on the principle that has been insisted upon by the two rapporteurs mr zwiefka and mr deprez which is the principle of community competence
this is an issue of community competence on which for practical reasons it is advisable to maintain certain responsibilities to be exercised by the member states but as mr barrot said these should be restricted in terms of scope and also time
there is no option to decline to exercise community competence and neither the council the commission nor parliament has the power to waive these community competences
having established this this is an exceptional procedure i believe that the amendments that we have debated and tabled and which i believe will be adopted by parliament tomorrow will make it possible to adopt this package of measures at first reading
i also hope however that on the part of the commission in the next stage and going forward we can progress with the development of a real european system of private law this is becoming increasingly necessary as pointed out for example by mr sógor in the previous speech
we are talking about problems that affect people most directly and to the extent that we are able to resolve their problems people will realise that the european union has a function
finally mr president i would like to congratulate my fellow members mr deprez and mr zwiefka and to thank the commission and the council for their willingness to work together with us on this issue
− madam president commissioner i have signed this resolution and asked to speak in this plenary because i was a witness to the so called expulsion of our colleague luis herrero which was in fact a kidnapping
what is more i had a chance to see how political persecution abuses of power by the chávez regime intimidation of the opposition threats disregard for human dignity and the misuse of justice are all a normal part of life in venezuela
the case of manuel rosales was the last straw and the catalyst for this resolution but there are thousands of cases just as bloody as his some of them are quoted in the resolution and others are not
his some of them are quoted in the resolution and others are not like the case of eligio cedeño who was born in the poor caracas suburb of petare a notoriously dangerous area well known for electing a mayor who was not from the chávez regime
eligio was educated with the help of others in particular from citibank he managed to set up his own business the bank of caracas and then lived a normal life also providing help to the most needy
today however he is illegally imprisoned in a caracas jail following two years of detention with no coherent case being made against him
his only crime was to be a part of the economic oligarchy
another case is that of nixon moreno a student leader at the university of the andes elected to the university council several times and president of the federation of university centres
in two thousand three he won the federation election against the current minister of interior and justice and that is his crime
today he is accused of attempted murder and lewd violent acts despite having been exonerated of the accusations
cases such as these are a feature of everyday life in venezuela where persecution of the opposition with the aim of excluding them from political life and of suppressing dissidents has become part of normal life
nevertheless we need to send a message of hope to venezuelan democracy despite the challenges i am sure democracy will be established and president chávez will be voted out
madam president commissioner indeed there is no doubt that progress has been made in recent times but despite all the progress that has been made the southern part of the european union is burning more and more
therefore the resolution that parliament has adopted cannot be one more resolution that serves to demonstrate our grave concern regarding disasters elsewhere
forest fires happen for a variety of reasons but no one can deny that they are fuelled by climate change
irrespective of the responsibilities that may exist in some member states or in some autonomous regions it is certain that parliament must clearly call on the commission to act swiftly and make available all the resources at its disposal which are not insignificant
the victims the damage suffered and the need for reforestation do not have any understanding of bureaucracy or of budget shortages
we need to prioritise and we need to act which in this case means changing strategies mobilising resources increasing them and optimising the preventive policies
them and optimising the preventive policies we need to demand that member states take responsibility if this is not the case but assume that this is not the problem of a few member states in southern europe and that climate change does not only affect some member states it affects them all and it is a common cause
therefore one of the main tasks that parliament has is to ensure that the european union achieves clear firm commitments at the copenhagen summit
firm commitments at the copenhagen summit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible because they are obviously behind the fires behind their causes and in turn behind the causes of further climate change
therefore having adopted this resolution this is undoubtedly the challenge for parliament
however this challenge for the commission needs to be met if the commissioner truly wants to prevent the southern part of the union which does indeed exist from continuing to burn
mr president i wish to direct my comments to mr barroso
mr barroso i have listened to you with great interest and also great respect for a very long time in fact since you were a politician in a country that is very close to us and our hearts namely portugal
however you have just totally surprised me
there are two reasons for this firstly you have demonstrated contempt for the group to which i belong the group of non attached members by not giving us even a minute of your time to explain your political proposals
we represent many european citizens and you have demonstrated contempt for all our voters
secondly your political plan is weak and your political proposals in the document political guidelines for the next commission are poor
these proposals do not even include what you yourself have defended during your term as commission president
i am surprised that issues such as energy which throughout your term of office have been well handled are now when you are offering your proposals for the next
madam president commissioner you ended your speech by saying that there is a crisis in the milk sector and yet you started by saying that all possible measures have already been taken and that the situation is being sorted out
you should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong
that is a saying in spain which could very well be applied to this situation
for months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history despite that because the european commission and certain governments seemingly including my own the spanish government do not want to allow their arms to be twisted they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy
those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed
it makes you think that the member states did not want to see or could not see at that time the storm that was approaching
the reform has very quickly become irrelevant due to the major turnaround in the market which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility
the fact that major producers such as france and germany countries which in absolute terms obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues
as i see it the member states were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices including mine which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until twenty eleven
it is a shame that no one listened to us
perhaps you should do so now
mr president this parliament is the palace of the imagination the palace of dreams
with their very strong vote the people of ireland are giving us the spirit and the strength to continue to prosper and to build a strong and above all federal europe
it is only by doing this that we will deserve the title of legitimate heirs of the fathers of europe through whose efforts we are all here today
mr president now that the worries generated by the approval of the treaty of lisbon have been overcome it is time in my view to think about the way in which we should in future handle the nationalist attitudes that do so much to hinder european integration
my view is that these obstacles cannot be free of charge
with a cool head it is time to think about the possible measures that will need to be taken in the days and years to come
this simple m e p wants a president of the council in the future who is a man or better a woman who supports european federalism uses the
uses the euro is located in the schengen area and identifies and agrees with the charter of fundamental rights of the european union
mr president having listened to the commissioner there would really be nothing left for me to say but amen ' but i already had a speech prepared on behalf of the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament
the breakdown of constitutional order in honduras brings an end to two decades without coups in latin america and creates a bad precedent for other countries and especially the weakest ones such as paraguay currently
the european parliament cannot and should not remain deaf and mute in the face of such a violation of the rule of law
both the council and the commission have made unambiguous statements condemning the coup and supporting the mediation by president arias in line with the position unanimously adopted by the o a s with the backing of the united nations
the self proclaimed president mr micheletti has not abided by the agreements reached recently mocking the international community and one of his moves has been to prevent mr zelaya the deposed president from being reinstated
under the current circumstances the election of a new president at the elections scheduled for twenty nine november would be devoid of legitimacy from the outset and its results cannot and should not be recognised by the international community
the european parliament would be committing a grave error if it sent a delegation to observe the elections since this would be interpreted as support for the the o a s has already ruled out sending an observation mission to the elections
this parliament has described itself as a guarantor of freedom democracy the rule of law and respect for human rights
as václav havel said this morning we cannot have double standards
here we are all democrats and therefore fighters for freedom consequently whether we are talking of cuba china north korea or as now honduras our debate must be resolute in the face of destroyers of freedom
let us not allow ourselves to be blinded by our ideological preferences
there are no right wing or left wing coup leaders or dictators merely repressive and freedom destroying ones
we very much fear that things in honduras are not going to change and that these events will have created a very dangerous precedent and that the doctrine of the good timely and not overly bloody coup will have triumphed
madam president i would like to congratulate the members of the committee on the environment public health and food safety and its chairman mr leinen on the work that they have done in order for us to have a resolution such as this which we must emphatically adopt
we cannot content ourselves with saying that sectoral agreements are enough because talking about what could be called a remnant agreement is admitting partial failure
we need to adopt this resolution which has three noble aspirations
the first is more obvious avoiding climate change with tangible proposals to reduce emissions and a commitment to funding which aspires to a binding agreement not a remnant agreement
there are also two underlying aspirations the first is to start working towards a common energy policy sooner rather than later just as in the past we equipped ourselves with a common agricultural policy because we needed it there is also of course the aspiration to regain the citizens confidence in politics and politicians which is somewhat lacking in europe
success at the summit will therefore amount to success regarding the three aspirations
consequently i urge the president in office of the council to maintain his optimism and to apply pressure and negotiate as much as he can to draw the others towards this success
i do not know whether the leaders of this multipolar world want to be judged by history for not being capable of achieving a binding agreement but i do not think that i as an m e p along with all the representatives of the people should be judged by history for not being capable of taking forward in copenhagen the binding commitment we have with humanity to prevent climate change
mr president today there is no doubt about the european union s commitment to the fight against terrorism and thanks to the stockholm programme we will continue to make progress on this essential area of freedom security and justice
in my view this fight has been based on mutual trust between the member states but now with the possibilities opened up by the treaty of lisbon it is high time to harmonise national legislation so that there is no time limit on prosecuting terrorist crimes which should be considered as crimes against humanity
when this happens nobody in this parliament or in any other will defend terrorists as has happened is happening and may continue to happen to the detriment of victims of terrorism who watch those who murdered their loved ones being treated like heroes while they suffer in silence
i therefore ask parliament to drive forward or adopt a european charter for the rights of the victims of terrorism based on defending the memory
madam president i would like to begin by congratulating mrs mcguinness on this initiative which demonstrates the important role that the common agricultural policy plays in meeting food provision needs internationally
now that the european commission seems to want to reduce the burden of the c a p on the community budget it is important to stress that while the c a p may not be a priority food sufficiency must be in past decades it has been clear that without the c a p it is very difficult if not impossible to achieve food sufficiency
agriculture cannot therefore be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market because the food market is not a free market
farmers need the support of the european union in order for their businesses to succeed and the european union in turn needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens
i therefore believe that we must change the course of the c a p but not abolish it
in order to do this direct aid must be guaranteed to farmers and a policy of managing agricultural markets must be restored to bring about greater price stability which would benefit not only farmers but also consumers and third countries
a framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins
in addition a european consumer information policy that highlights efforts by community producers to comply with european union regulations in the areas of the environment
environment food security and animal welfare is needed since community producers have to compete with imports from third countries where the standards applied are much lower
third country producers prefer to export to the european union rather than supplying their own countries markets because such exports are more profitable under world trade organisation agreements
according to a united nations report in two thousand nine some two hundred seventy thousand people were victims of human trafficking within the european union
with these figures in mind we need to ensure that european union action is based first and foremost on victim protection with special focus on the situation of women and children who are the most vulnerable
we cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the play that is being enacted to the sideshow of sexual exploitation that is unfolding before our eyes
for this reason i completely support the parliament s demands that victim assistance should be unconditional and that more forceful methods and more severe penalties should be adopted as mr barrot has just told us
having said that i would like to call on the spanish presidency the european commission and the council to use all the european legislation at their disposal both existing and future legislation to protect the victims of human trafficking
i consider that the proposed european victim protection system which i personally demanded from the spanish presidency during the stockholm programme debates and which has finally come to fruition will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes
i hope for a firm undertaking as we have already seen from the spanish presidency to ensure that this system offers victims special protective measures that will be effective throughout the european union
i hope that we who are responsible for taking action against the most severe problems in our society will come up with a real and substantial response to this extremely severe problem of human trafficking and that our words will not be empty promises
we really owe it to all the victims
mr zapatero for a spaniard such as i am it is an honour to greet you here as you take your turn as the president of the european union
this is a period of many expectations and challenges and of course we must not fail to live up to those expectations
it is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems
you know that we agree with the programme you have put forward
you know that for the spanish this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of europe and that is important to spain
it is an ambitious programme and hopefully a programme full of content
i hope that in this album of the spanish presidency since it will surely be colourful and varied people can see every event as a milestone in the very real problems that affect them
the crisis is hitting economies and unemployment seems like the fifth horse of the apocalypse
you have had the honesty to recognise that there is twenty percent unemployment in spain but that does not curtail you
i believe that it obliges us all to come up with a solution to a problem that we must solve together
it is a real problem
the time available does not allow me to say too much prime minister
however i do want to tell you that spain faces many challenges ahead that i am certain of spain s capability as a nation and that i want to believe and am sure that you will rise to the challenge
at this time in europe we must not fail to live up to these expectations on the other hand the globalised world and you have referred to it with intelligence means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the european union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests
otherwise we run the risk of becoming irrelevant
finally prime minister we spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals
we have that right
we must also have the humility to accept the advice that don quixote gave to sancho panza when he recommended humility in his fantasy about governing the isle of barataria
i am pleased to have the opportunity to say that josé luis zapatero has not failed to surprise european women with highly innovative and progressive measures
he has of course done so by forming a truly equal government and through the brave manner in which he has brought the matters of gender equality and mutual respect to the national and european agendas
prime minister i warmly congratulate you on your ambitious programme of action against gender violence which is a social scourge
the creation of a european watchdog on gender violence is an avant garde proposal which the women of europe support and applaud
prime minister on behalf of the portuguese socialists i wish you luck
you can count on our solidarity
women for zapatero
mr president when dealing with a topic as serious as terrorism we should not wait for things to happen before we act
we should anticipate events but we do not
unfortunately we only change in response to each attack such as the failed attack in detroit which is forcing us today to take decisions to ensure the safety of air transport
taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid ladies and gentlemen
we cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting
consequently the commission must guarantee as soon as possible that the dignity and privacy of individuals will be preserved and that there will be no harmful effects on health
once this is guaranteed we must adopt decisions for the european union as a whole
to those who are worried about infringement of our fundamental rights i say that there is no greater right than the right to life and those of us who cherish freedom above all else must be able to live safely in order to feel truly free
madam president i believe that this crisis is an opportunity to move forward firmly and with conviction in creating a strong europe
in this strong europe we will probably have to dispense with the expression improving coordination ' as it means that everything is dependent on the subjects that have to be coordinated and inevitably leads to paralysis and a lack of clarity
we know that the finances and the public deficits of european countries will suffer until we move towards european financial integration and eurobonds are issued
in any case the european institutions can already take specific action i will not focus on all the hot air about coordination on the one hand we have the european central bank for harmonising financial supervision and on
mr president i would like to say that i did not come to parliament to applaud the brand new law in spain on abortion
what i am concerned about is human life and i am particularly concerned about the women who i am here to defend whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence and i am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely
parliament s resolution of two february two thousand six recommended that the member states adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims
the stockholm programme which was adopted in this house established an area of freedom justice and security for all european citizens and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that programme
this reflected my request for the spanish presidency to promote a european protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the member states
in a europe without borders the fight against gender violence should also be without borders and the member states should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill treatment of women overcomes the
legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children at least within the european union i therefore ask the commission and the council to do everything that
that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the european protection order for victims which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished
mr president fidel castro and his oligarchs betrayed the ideals of the cuban revolution long ago those ideals had been shared by peoples the world over especially the cream of international youth whom they inspired
at present however the castro brothers dictatorship is characterised by a lack of compassion for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and for their own people
it puts me in mind of the period when franco was on his deathbed because of the mistreatment of political prisoners who were also perceived as common criminals and because of the same obsessive disdain towards exiles
castro has ended up like franco and all other enemies of freedom who become entrenched in power
nonetheless we are called upon to save lives and display solidarity with those who are fighting and suffering
that is our duty as europeans who are committed to democracy freedom and human rights
madam president mr lópez garrido commissioner let us never again allow our silence to result in us colluding with liberticide
let us never again allow a person who fought for his rights and the rights of all to die in prison in cuba or anywhere else without speaking out loudly and firmly to demand that he be saved
mr orlando zapata tamayo a forty two year old black builder who was only asking for his conditions in prison to be improved died after eighty six days on hunger strike and seven years in prison for demanding that human rights be respected
during this seven year period he was mistreated humiliated and harassed by his guards during which time we should not forget there was nothing but silence from the international community
other prisoners and human rights activists in cuba are currently on hunger strike such as the psychologist and journalist guillermo fariñas
ladies and gentlemen the resolution that we are tabling and debating today and which we will vote on tomorrow which i represent on behalf of the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament demands that all prisoners of conscience in cuba be freed
once again it is in favour of a democratic transition and of strict respect for fundamental human rights
for the moment let us not enter into a subject that divides us whether the common position should be maintained or not
let us focus now on saving lives and on human rights
let us also open up a period of calm reflection in which we seek out points of agreement on future policy regarding cuba
this text does however have significant added value
the fact that it is being tabled by six political groups expresses a new era of broad consensus in this house on the subject of human rights
let it never again be said that european democratic law yields to the orders in inverted commas of yankee imperialism however let it also never be said again that the socialists and democrats are complacent or complicit in communist dictatorships
i say this quite simply because both of these statements are false and the victims of liberticide wherever they may be need to know that we are united in unconditionally defending their cause
madam president finally i would like to thank mr salafranca who negotiated this text on behalf of the group of the european people s party mrs weber from the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe mr
romeva i rueda on behalf of the group of the greens european free alliance mr kožušník from the european conservatives and reformists and other fellow members who have taken part in this task which has been difficult and complicated but which i hope will be successful tomorrow
finally i would also like to thank the spanish prime minister and current president of the european union mr rodríguez zapatero for his encouragement and support for moving forward with this resolution that we are debating today
history will absolve me was the famous statement of a young lawyer who stirred his people
history does absolve him for his revolt against tyranny and then against the united states embargo
however it is with the same emphatic judgment that parliament which represents the largest area of freedom and democracy in the world condemns the dictatorship suffered
the dictatorship suffered by the people of cuba the violation of human rights on the island the cruelty to political prisoners and the contempt for its nationals in exile
the judgment of history is clear
through this resolution members from all ideologies are standing alongside the cuban people in their struggle
we need to do everything we can to prevent the brutal oppression that they are suffering which includes cancelling the paralysing common position
i will pay tribute to raúl rivero in the last verses that he wrote in his city of havana which say that they do not tax affection emptiness suffocation or bitterness
the ruins of the homeland are safe
do not worry comrades
now we are going
mr president ladies and gentlemen this week we are celebrating international women s day
in this parliament we have seen a great many posters in all the languages of the european union saying that we can put a stop to violence against women
today we are talking about violence in mexico and i think it is right that we should recognise that mexican women both indigenous and non indigenous victims receive the least protection from local and federal authorities
mexican women are victims of all forms of violence from domestic violence to sexual violence and torture carried out by the army or the police and they also become murder victims
regrettably up to now the response from the mexican authorities has been ineffective which is why we can now accurately say that we are looking at a case of almost total impunity
our resolution calls on the mexican government to fight against femicide which is a harsh word but an accurate one when we consider that almost all the murders involving female victims go unpunished
for example during the past four years in mexico only eleven percent of the criminals who murdered almost seven hundred women have been sentenced
at the same time it would appear that women are the judicial system s favourite victims
there is no other way to explain how it was possible for two indigenous women alberta alcántara and teresa gonzález to be sentenced to twenty one years in prison and to have
now spent more than three years in jail for kidnapping six men from the federal investigations agency all by themselves during an incident in a market
let us hope that the judge who will make a decision on the women s appeal in one week s time realises how ridiculous and unjust the situation is however violence against women starts in the home
i hope that mexican legislators will soon make improvements to the general law on women's access to a life free of violence so that the different forms of violence and the mechanisms implementing the laws can be properly defined
it would also be right to establish domestic violence and rape within marriage as criminal offences
furthermore in order for mexican society to change and reject violence against women it is important that schools deal with this issue as a basic matter of education for young people
madam president to be honest the first thing i wanted to do this evening is to thank mr scottà for his excellent skill in negotiating this report
it has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups
we are proud of the position that will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote in parliament and on a report such as this which defends quality and which commits to the development and enhancement of rural areas not only as
of a traditional european culture but as true wealth and job creation agents these are jobs that we currently need so much at this time of economic crisis and such a dramatic situation in terms of levels of employment in some member states
in addition we are pleased with the protection maintained by parliament and the position already maintained by the committee on agriculture and rural development as it has made clear in committing to quality of the highest standard
with regard to that highest standard moreover we naturally commit to maintaining that differentiation between protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication
of course we reject ideas of levelling quality downwards and we want e u production to receive attention and be valued
i am delighted at what mr cioloş had to say
it was of course pleasing to hear him speak about commitment to the future of the european farming environment
we naturally hope he will listen to parliament s voice which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote
finally i would like to say let us hope that it never happens again that the european commission gets ahead of parliament by prohibiting things such as for example marketing standards for fruit and vegetables that have caused such damage to european free competition
we want the imbalances in the market corrected and we also want to commit to quality variety food safety and the right quantity of production
in addition we want e u production and the quality of that e u agricultural and food production to be defended in the world trade organisation
we are of course also relying on the work of mr cioloş for that because neither our european producers nor our european consumers can go on being defenceless
mr president the commissioner talked about the procedures being absurd and obsolete
let us therefore be consistent
we have wasted too many opportunities too many treaties when we could have introduced community powers over european airspace
nevertheless while we were not able to act as we should have done in the air we can do so on the ground
for example we can monitor passengers rights and also mediate or ask for a truce in the various land transport industrial disputes
there should be no minimum services there should be maximum services for all
− madam president when people coming from positions as different and far removed as those of mr mauro mr gollnisch and mr colman come to the conclusion that
the conclusion that there are problems with the electoral procedure and systems for the election of meps to the european parliament it means that we need a uniform electoral procedure
that was a mandate that already existed in the treaties of rome therefore we coordinators and i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them most especially mr jáuregui and mr duff have agreed on amendment
two which will be voted on tomorrow i hope that this amendment will be supported by this house particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the european parliament
by means of this we would it seems to me remove this type of question mark
in his speech mr trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this parliament something that the majority of the speakers and vice president šefčovič among others have also highlighted
i agree indeed we say as much in paragraph one of the report to the extent that the eighteen meps should enter otherwise we would lose representativeness
in order for them to enter in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the treaty of lisbon we have to be practical because a transitional and exceptional situation ladies and gentlemen also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions
this is why and i am quite open about it i do not like the possibility of meps joining this parliament who were not elected in two thousand nine something which by the way i clearly state in paragraph two of the report nevertheless if i have to choose between that and the eighteen members not taking their seats or coming up with
eighteen members not taking their seats or coming up with a practical solution and the eighteen joining meaning therefore that we comply with the treaty of lisbon i ask this house as i have already done in the report to choose that solution a transitional and pragmatic one but above all madam president a just one
i would like to thank everyone for their collaboration and for the interesting contributions that were made to this report
mr president i would like to take the opportunity in this house today as i was unable to do so on the european day for the victims of terrorism on eleven march to pay a well deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom
we urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of the victims of terrorism who are always the ones who are overlooked and who suffer the humiliation of being unjustly equated with their murderers
it is high time that we within these european institutions recognise the dignity of the victims of terrorism and help to defend their right to protection and justice this right should soon be embodied in a law
that honours all those who make this possible whose first article should state that support to victims of terrorism entails recognition of their right to justice and that no government should ever pay a price for this
i call on all those in a position to defend the victims never to forget that true peace is a peace born of justice and that is the only peace that those of us who believe in freedom and democracy in europe and anywhere else in the world should defend
mr president we had to be on the brink of the economic abyss in order for the heads of state or government to understand that the way forward is not more nationalism but more europe
some measures that have been adopted are aimed in this direction such as the reduction in vetoing rights in the european council or the seeds of a european public treasury
finally albeit late in the day we have realised that we are all in the same boat and there is no point dealing with individual situations especially in an improvised way
i wonder however whether this attitude is a digression or conversely whether it is the start of real european economic governance because what we do not need ladies and gentlemen is governance what we need is authentic government if we want to be true to the will of the founding fathers
parliament must therefore promote all the reforms aimed at strengthening europe and make budgetary and fiscal discipline a reality while forgetting about nostalgic sovereignty
ladies and gentlemen strengthening the european commission and strengthening parliament is the only right recipe for building europe as otherwise it would disappear like a thief in the night
mr president commissioner on behalf of the committee on international trade i should like to thank mrs de sarnez for the way she has worked with us
today more than ever before there is a need for the union for the mediterranean for support for major projects and for institutional development
today more than ever before there is a need to find answers to the crisis to research to climate change to water to new energy models to sustainable development
we must therefore promote and conclude trade and economic relations in the area with short and medium term measures a free trade zone lifting of tariff barriers and the opening up of the north south and south south markets
at the barcelona summit the spanish presidency will offer the opportunity for a new agreement a new situation a new collaboration democratisation economic and social responses
the barcelona summit can put us into the position where we can assume leadership in the mediterranean
madam president one of the trans european transport corridors is the rail corridor known as the mediterranean corridor '
it is a vital link that will link north africa with europe
it is vital for spain because this line is a priority given that it would link algeciras with europe
it would not exclude other priority corridors and would pass through almería murcia the community of valencia and catalonia
the reason was mentioned by commissioner reding greater economic activity and a greater concentration of land transport
this is one of the two conditions
it would open up the possibility of linking with various sea ports in the mediterranean
we need to provide economic impetus and be competitive something that the commissioner was also saying because this area produces more than fifty percent of spanish exports
therefore if we promote a strategic rail network through the mediterranean we will achieve greater competitiveness for spain and for europe
madam president i would like to take this opportunity to thank the spanish rotating presidency for the efforts that it has made during this six month period to overcome the
to overcome the common position on cuba and create a new type of relationship between the european union and cuba which of course prioritises defending human rights
the policy has not been crowned with success basically due to the intransigence of the cuban dictatorship this january the cuban government began the spanish presidency
with the expulsion of the member of parliament who spoke to them when they tried to visit the island entirely legally with all the required visas to focus on human rights
this new policy undertaken by the spanish government will however produce results sooner rather than later
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri food industry because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it
this is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it
i agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles especially if we bear in mind that the commission failed
commitment to establish these profiles as well as the conditions for their use before nineteen january as laid down in regulation no nineteen twenty four two thousand six
an issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market
as regards the indication of country of origin under the current legislation this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer
there is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling
going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit
on the use of different languages i have to say that the commission s proposal matches up with the existing directive which has worked well and not caused problems
reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary and could cause problems with the movement of products
mr president the thousand amendments from the committee that we are seeing in parliament are the best demonstration of our goodwill
however as well as goodwill i think that we have to be practical when labelling food if we do not want to have the opposite effect to the one we are aiming for in other words confusing consumers rather than informing them
it is a case of warning not explaining it is a case of informing them what they can eat and in what quantities they can eat it
is labelling on fat sugar and transfats necessary
indeed it is
is labelling on things that affect cholesterol on all substances that affect what we have mentioned obesity and people s health necessary
it is nevertheless including other types of information whilst potentially very informative could end up being confusing in the case of some foodstuffs for example the place of origin or in the case of meat where the beast was born where it has passed through where it was raised and where it was slaughtered
it is up to us to be practical and to make sure that this regulation becomes one that will harmonise and inform consumers if not it will cause greater confusion and impose issues that far from achieving better levels of health will achieve greater levels of confusion
that is why i suggest that for some foodstuffs we opt for a guideline daily amount instead of the traffic lights because that way it is very clear that if you eat a certain amount or twice that amount of a given product you will get fat and therefore that you should only eat one of them
some of us are suggesting a maximum daily allowance in place of other types of code so as not to confuse consumers further
madam president mr fragueiro thank you very much for being here on behalf of the spanish presidency for a report such as this commissioner
mr milana congratulations on being capable of reaching a joint agreement bringing together all the interests and bringing one of the first reports on this initiative to the table
the spread of aquaculture is important
it is necessary due to the increase in fish consumption and the stagnation of fishing capacity i do however want to highlight the economic importance of fishing which generates wealth and employment
health guarantees sustainability and protecting the marine environment are all important
we need to improve the image of aquaculture and also of the scientific and research sector
aquaculture is an opportunity as mr fragueiro said within the common fisheries policy as the commissioner said
we need to give it a coherent coordination framework we need to give it the opportunity to bring itself into line because aquaculture can mean sufficiency sustainability and economic resources and i think it is important for europe
mr president in my opinion this excellent report sets out the guidelines that must inspire the new white paper on transport that will shape european transport policy for the next ten years
this report includes several issues that are worth outlining the need for a financial fund as an essential instrument the challenge of the growing demands of freight transport the search for comodal solutions that
for comodal solutions that make users and freight safe the vital need for sufficient and secure rest areas for road transport the in my opinion correct diagnosis that the various modes of transport must complement each other with efficiency criteria being sought rather than merely being in competition
modes of transport must complement each other with efficiency criteria being sought rather than merely being in competition with each other and the rapporteur s brave in my opinion and fair assertion that transport by rail or sea is not always more environmentally friendly than road transport
in short the concept of efficient comodality is a concept for the future and it must certainly in my opinion be given full support
mr president mr rodríguez zapatero you made an error in your approach
you thought that you were actually going to preside over europe and have an influence on the gear wheels that make the complex european machinery work
you came to believe this because that is what you let people around you announce that the world was going to experience a stellar moment under your presidency
none of this has come to pass
let us move on to some details
with regard to these six months of spanish presidency i would like to make a distinction between its political management on the one hand and the work that has been carried out by the workers in the engine rooms on the other
it is the first of these that has failed and that is due to a lack of adequate impetus from the presidency of the government which has fashioned a european presidency in accordance with the swing of the pendulum
however i would like to highlight the efforts made by the workers and their estimable desire to serve europe and spain
it is a fact mr president that spain has magnificent professional staff and it is to be regretted that they are marginalised to such an extent in day to day reality
that said it must be acknowledged that several praiseworthy initiatives have been adopted during these six months
of these i am pleased to mention the organ donation and transplantation plan and the work carried out on the rights of patients with regard to cross border healthcare
the agreements on the new europe twenty twenty strategy and in particular those relating to the european external action service which are both still too fragile are more up in the air
what occurred with the european protection order for victims of violence against women was regrettable and the basic community patent yielded the same sombre result
basic community patent yielded the same sombre result for the livelihoods of thousands of companies blocked in part by the linguistic problems engendered by spanish legislation
however it is the large scale political gestures that have provided a closing balance of spectacular failure from the mediterranean summit to the one between the european union and the united states with your own government being responsible for creating excessive expectations with regard to the latter meeting
however we would have to agree that not being able to move forward with your policy with regard to cuba has been highly positive for the cubans
finally the advances made on the road towards better european economic governance cannot be attributed in any way to your presidency which was resoundingly absent on all of the most important questions
goodbye then to the spanish presidency
i would like to draw one positive conclusion from this experience my imagination as a convinced pro european is excited when i think that this could mean the end of rotating presidencies as they have been conceived of to date
this would be good news as until europe strengthens its common institutions by solidly uniting their fragments it will continue to run the risk of finding itself suffocating in the vacuum of irrelevance
mr president mr rodríguez zapatero i would have liked to have made a different speech today believe me
you set out six months full of ambition and set the bar so high with your claims that when these are compared with what was actually achieved disappointment was inevitable
what is certain is that you have not been able to overcome a complex situation for which you lacked leadership and credibility
you yourself pointed out once that the european union is a club with rules and i agree
however it was up to you to demand obedience to these rules
the reality is that it was the government of spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations
within this context positive achievements whilst not lacking have been undistinguished
unlike me you have had time to talk about them
democracy is a public opinion based system
this is how it seems president obama s disdain as well as the cancellation of the mediterranean summit and the one announced between the european union and the united states constitute very significant failures
the rush to reach improvised agreements at any cost has not helped the image of spanish management as a way of achieving a respectable objective it could be described as amateurish
spain is a great nation and will continue to be one despite the poor management of this period
our diplomats and officials have kept a stiff upper lip and thanks to this spain s prestige will survive
the truth is that the situation in spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this presidency than what was done or not done here
someone who has taken his country into a phase of uncertainty and unrest would have difficulty in providing leadership for an enterprise this difficult
at best this presidency has been sadly irrelevant
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy
it is important to reach a satisfactory agreement and so i hope that the belgian presidency manages to achieve what the spanish presidency did not i hope that the belgian presidency can direct discussions in such a way that the member states commit themselves to maintaining a truly strong c a p in the future
truly strong c a p in the future with a sufficient budget for meeting the needs of the twenty seven member states both new and old i also hope that it will not be as it was in two thousand five when there was a lack of money and a modulation had to be improvised
in the upcoming reform of the c a p we are gambling with the viability of a sector that not only provides intangible goods and services such as care for the environment but must also guarantee the supply of food to the european public
we have witnessed distressing shortage situations in the past which is why the european parliament should make security of supply based on e u production the main objective of the next reform without leaving aside other contributions such as the fight against climate change
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i agree with commissioner cioloş that this report is essential and comes at the right time because it has demonstrated the abuses committed by mass distribution severely disrupting the various links in the food chain
while the bové report may go too far on some points by seeking to be too interventionist it must be acknowledged that from the point of view of the social market economy that we advocate in the group of the european people s party it provides responses to the justified complaints made by european producers
it also brings transparency to the different parts of the food chain which is always a good thing offers the weakest sectors in the chain much more opportunities to defend themselves and of course supports european consumers in becoming more informed about that food chain
the european food industry could perhaps have been taken into account to a greater extent in this report which would have been a good thing but the report does also include measures for curbing the volatility of prices which was very necessary
it also sets out measures for achieving equality between the links in the chain as requested by the committee on the environment public health and food safety and it also asks for abusive and unfair practices in mass distribution to be combated
the time is now coming to establish a list of abusive practices to be strictly banned by european legislation
it is also important that measures be set out for preventing difficult practices through private labels that go against competition and intellectual property law
for all these reasons we should support the bové report and all our fellow members in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection the committee on the environment public health and food safety and the committee on agriculture and rural development who have worked hard to ensure that this report was finally published to help european producers move forwards
mr president mrs de lange says that the alarm bell is ringing and she is right
another thing that we are hearing is frustration for example in the speeches in parliament at not having achieved the millennium development goals
the truth is that there is a great deal at stake
our natural environment is so fragile that if one day the big fish decided that it was not going to continue eating the little fish we would have to pay for it using our health and welfare as currency
the european union is currently a leader in the fight against climate change and has been a leader for some time in pioneering measures and conservation
however as the unmet targets show it seems that there has been a lack of will not only for the implementation and coordination which have also been mentioned here but also for expanding beyond our extremely limited special conservation areas
of course biodiversity is not a museum piece that can be enclosed in a ghetto and just checked up on now and again as sometimes appears to be the case
biodiversity is living and has no borders so it covers the whole planet with a domino effect that means that if one domino falls all the rest fall too
i also want to draw attention to the need for a global and more union oriented will especially in relation to soil because using subsidiarity as the only method for managing soil or woodland could be one of the new fearsome enemies of biodiversity
this is why i am drawing attention to paragraph sixty seven and the possible result of the vote and i ask you to reject the second part because i am convinced that a common policy on soil would help to conserve the whole of europe s territory
europe s territory which for better or for worse is so diverse so lacking in political will on the part of the member states and so much in need of a greater level of european union involvement in the broadest sense of the word more union for the soil as well
mr president commissioner i would first of all like to highlight the work that has been done by the rapporteur mrs mcavan not only on the content of the report but also in terms of her methods because she has worked alongside all the shadow rapporteurs
i would also like to thank the experts from the spanish government for their contribution to this agreement
the purpose of this system of pharmacovigilance in the european union is to strengthen vigilance transparency and communication in relation to the safety of drugs once they have been put on the market especially with regard to their risk profiles and the adverse reactions that they can cause
it is important to highlight the creation of the european pharmacovigilance committee which will evaluate and issue recommendations to the european medicines agency on the safety issues that can arise in connection with medicines sold in the european union
the solution that has been reached for both member states and those responsible for marketing medicines to notify the eudravigilance database of suspected adverse reactions is very important
eudravigilance will be the only source of information but the competent authority in the member state where it is suspected that an adverse reaction has occurred will be informed at the same time which is very important
it is also important to highlight the possibility that is being opened up of consumers being able to communicate any adverse reactions and in this respect the creation and management by the agency of a
european medicines safety web portal which in turn is linked to the portals in each of the member states is going to help to improve the public s knowledge regarding the safety of the medicines that they take
finally we cannot forget that given that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role in protecting public health the adoption of this directive and this
this regulation is going to make a significant contribution to that protection by improving not only the current procedures but also the coordination of actions between the different member states
mr president i thank the rapporteur for making the effort to accept some suggestions and of course for her defence of copyright which i agree with however the fact that certain exchanges are defined in the report as infringements that are punishable that the authority of providers to issue punishments is recognised and
in the report as infringements that are punishable that the authority of providers to issue punishments is recognised and that mass exchanges are excluded as possible infringements mean it is impossible for us to vote in favour of either of the two opposing reports
the gallo report provoked a great deal of interest and could have been appropriate but the core of the debate is too bitter surrounding the arguments for and against the french law known as h a d o p i
as h a d o p i which involves cutting off the internet connections of those who infringe the rules there has not yet been a genuine european debate taking into account other progress in national legislation
i hope that we will achieve a common position in the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament and a majority in parliament in the debates and amendments on the proposal for a directive from the commission which according to commissioner barnier will shortly arrive in parliament
on this occasion we will try to arrive at a more balanced position than we have today that takes into account both the rights of internet users and the essential need for intellectual property to be respected
madam president i would like to congratulate those who have worked on this financial package especially the staff and members of this house
it took a financial crisis of huge proportions for europe to wake up
however an opportunity has been lost in part to strengthen the joint institutions of europe because on the one hand these new supervisory authorities have a limited scope of competence
limited scope of competence compared to similar authorities in member states moreover it is a shame that progress has not been made on similar integration to that which took place with the european system of central banks
we have made progress but we need to keep climbing the mountain
madam president as a member of the committee on human rights as a spanish and european citizen and as a victim of terrorism since the terrorist organisation e t a murdered my brother and his wife in seville i am speaking here today to condemn the fact that the venezuelan government and its president has allowed e t a terrorists to train on venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist arturo cubillas who works for hugo chávez s government despite the fact that there
e t a terrorists to train on venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist arturo cubillas who works for hugo chávez s government despite the fact that there is an international warrant out for his arrest this is a serious violation of the fundamental right to all european citizens right to security
i demand firm action from the spanish government in response to this serious humiliation of all the spanish people
mr zapatero cannot continue to keep quiet while the venezuelan ambassador describes the members of our civil guard who have been and will continue to be models of bravery in the fight against e t a as
can he look the other way as cooperation on venezuelan soil between e t a and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia grows which has already been condemned by the judge eloy velasco
mr zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as mr chávez who is turning venezuela into a haven for terrorists
the prime minister of a country such as spain where terrorism has caused so much pain cannot continue to ignore this problem and should give the response that such a situation deserves which is what any ordinary citizen would do if they had the opportunity
mr president on fourteen february two thousand eight as a valentine s gift the conference of presidents decided that the intergroups would only meet on thursdays
since then we have been trying to resolve this issue
we have not managed to do so
now the intergroups have to meet on an unsuitable date
they almost never have rooms and they never have interpretation
i am speaking today not only as the chair of the intergroup on poverty and human rights but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this house and therefore from the members of this house who are part of those intergroups
i formally ask the conference of presidents to reconsider and to revoke the decision of fourteen february two thousand eight going back to the previous situation of giving freedom to the intergroups
if it does not do so i would like to say respectfully that we will bring the matter to parliament s plenary session which will decide who is sovereign in this house which is parliament
mr president on the international day against human trafficking for social exploitation some figures were revealed that should make us act as political leaders
more than ninety percent of the prostitution in europe arises from blackmail and extortion
in response to these figures we should ask ourselves if we are doing everything necessary to protect the dignity and integrity of thousands of women whose rights are also protected by the charter of fundamental rights that we adopted with the treaty of lisbon
we are not talking about the oldest profession in the world ' but about the only form of slavery that we have not succeeded in eradicating from the old europe
countries such as spain are making significant efforts in this respect prosecuting traffickers raising public awareness and promoting reintegration plans for the women who are the victims
this is not enough
europe needs to be a single area of action and commitment
the next directive on trafficking is an opportunity to act on the demand for the industry through education and in terms of supply for example to make advertising difficult in all types of media as well as increasing bilateral cooperation with third countries to fight this scourge from its source
we have an opportunity
i would like to draw parliament s attention to this so that it continues to be in the vanguard in terms of citizens rights
madam president we all agree that the external action service is an historic opportunity for european integration
however we need to have a broad perspective on it as this is not the time for internal battles about resources being transferred or being retained in the short term or for wars between the different european institutions
instead what we need now is to have a general view of what the european union has to be in the world in other words we need to do exactly the opposite of what
what happened a few days ago when the nobel peace prize was awarded when too many voices were heard from europe which were not all brave voices
i should point out that one of the exceptions to this was the president of this house mr buzek who produced a brilliant and commendable statement
mr president the regulation that we are debating today is of vital importance for the future of the cutlery and similar products sector which in my region don quixote country specifically albacete represents not just the survival of more than eight thousand jobs but also part of its identity and future commitment to craftsmanship as a source of employment
the made in stamp on knives has been demanded for some time by social groups such as aprecu and the government of castilla la mancha has been fighting for it with the unanimous support of its regional parliament
origin marking is not interventionism it is a commitment to transparency in the commercial rules of play and in the fight against unfair competition
it means increasing the capacity of consumers to make decisions by choosing a product because they are taking into account not only its final price but also the mark of quality of the place of origin or the social conditions in which it is produced
above all it will represent a new possibility of optimism for many people who are having a difficult time but who today are feeling that we have not been indifferent in terms of backing fairer trade while at the same time giving added value to those who as well as producing do so while respecting social rights and the better conditions of european workers
i would therefore like to thank the rapporteur and mr menéndez del valle for their social conscience in this matter that is so important for my region
mr president we will see if i can bring a little calm to this fierce debate
it is regrettable that along with the european union some of its member states are still part of the g twenty
despite this anomaly which certainly weakens europe s image in the world it would be good if at least there was an overall common position in this global forum
in my view what would that common position be
in my humble opinion i believe the following firstly the adoption of a global agreement to tackle the consequences of the crisis cannot be delayed by adopting just a financial agreement secondly europe must maintain the euro as the benchmark currency or if it is preferred as an anchor to
prevent turbulence in the market from dragging us along and causing us to repeat the errors made throughout the twentieth century thirdly the euro must herald what europe must represent in the world of democratic values and public freedoms
public freedoms
in summary we need to be aware that in a global world in this global game those who only play national cards lose
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i think the rapporteur mrs meissner must be congratulated
we have had dissimilar even conflictive positions but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue
ladies and gentlemen the committee on transport and tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition
we accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire union although i will not spare members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness
it is obvious that the baltic sea the north sea and the english channel are more polluted and in my view sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter
the measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives
nonetheless i will repeat this again and again we still have work to do on this matter
unless we liberalise our ports resolutely they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co modality
the promotion of a c o reduction strategy aimed at altering the specific consequences of climate change is also to be welcomed
i think this is a good report that must be adopted
but we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster namely that affecting the gulf of mexico
in this respect the commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary within the framework of revision of the regulation of the european maritime safety agency to strengthen the role of the agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post hydrocarbon spill clean up tasks
commissioner this i believe is a necessary reform and the necessary mandate must be used to support these tasks
mr president the integrated maritime policy is a cross cutting regional and sectoral policy and the fisheries and aquaculture policy must be a part of it in a way that does not make it subordinate to other policies
we must all address the environmental and economic problems affecting society as a whole and the fisheries sector in particular new technologies fishing gear development of species a maritime economy
to create more and better jobs quality supplies international relations aimed at preventing piracy and favouring the governance of the sea which is devoid of barriers and not having any sustainability problems as in the case of iceland
this is what needs to be done if we intend to work towards an integrated maritime policy and if we intend to work for the environment and sustainability
madam president recently the church of our lady of salvation in baghdad was attacked and fifty eight people were killed mainly women and children purely because they were christians
al qaeda has proudly claimed responsibility for this deed
this is not an isolated incident but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on christians in majority muslim countries
there have been expulsions from morocco threats in turkey and attacks in india and nigeria
in january six christians were massacred at the door of a church in cairo
for how long will western democracies collude with this by remaining silent
fortunately president buzek has made a statement on behalf of parliament
the statement by the high representative baroness ashton condemning the attack limited itself to condemning a terrorist act
why is the motive not mentioned in other words the fact that they were christians which was the unequivocal reason behind the attack
i have not heard anything from mr zapatero nor have i heard anything from prime minister erdogan
what is the point of the alliance of civilisations
i am ashamed of our simple mindedness and cowardice
i cannot help recalling the late misunderstood oriana fallaci who announced the arrival of and was practically stoned for having the courage to condemn what was happening in this neurotic europe
mr president commissioner i share this house s aspiration
i want the european delegation s proposals to gain the support that they deserve in cancún
in the context of this debate there is a need to highlight the importance of cities in preserving the environment
there is an agreement among more than one thousand mayors in the european union that demonstrates that the problem is being acknowledged by those authorities which need to act in order for us to be successful
our fine words are worth nothing if we do not have the cooperation of city mayors
in order to secure that cooperation it is very important for emissions to be disclosed as cities produce eighty percent of greenhouse gases
emissions are currently not disclosed and what is even worse is that there is no common standard for measuring them
there is a non profit organisation called the c o disclosure project ' which collects information from thousands of businesses and could in my view also be used by local government
without the cooperation of the local government and mayors environmental action will come to nothing which is precisely what we want to avoid
mr president some have said that the condemnation of morocco is too mild given the magnitude of the repression of human rights in the sahara where morocco is nothing more than an occupying country with no sovereignty or legal entitlement whatsoever
what is important however is the message that europe as a whole and parliament will no longer stand for its violence
yesterday i was talking about the hague court here in parliament
i hope that the international community which sadly failed in its attempts to prevent genocide in rwanda yugoslavia and darfur will in this case prevent it in the western sahara and we will not have to see it before another court also in the hague but this time a war crimes tribunal
mr president commissioner the directive adopted in two thousand nine was a success because it updates the legislative framework governing the safety of toys
it is a major step in the right direction because it is showing us which way to go but it is not sufficient
we need to be constantly vigilant and alert to ensure that toys that are sold do not endanger the health and safety of children
all toys that are on the market have to comply with current legislation
we must revise and improve the monitoring mechanisms for detecting dangerous toys due to substances that are considered to be carcinogenic mutagenic or toxic to reproduction fragrances or other dangerous substances such as heteropolyanion compounds
the legislation to follow needs to be clearer regarding minimum age warnings and the dangers arising from inappropriate use
we need to ensure that the recommended age for toys is based on child behaviour studies
we need to be capable of adapting our legislation to scientific advances based on sound studies and be more rigorous in monitoring the market and toy imports
we need to work together increase cooperation between member states and rely on the customs services working together to monitor the route taken by imported toys
europeans are preparing to make their christmas purchases and we must guarantee that the products that they buy comply with all the safety requirements
madam president i think that in this debate we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report
the various political groups have shown their support for this directive which offers greater protection to victims
my question is therefore what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument
i repeat what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across europe finally becoming a reality
in the hope that parliament will adopt this report by a majority i would like to address the council and the commission to remind them that we have
we have overcome the legal hurdles in our negotiations and i welcome the fact that the commission acknowledges our work just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future
we should not therefore exclude ourselves but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the commission with which i promise to cooperate
let us therefore be brave and responsible and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer europe
i repeat let us help everyone be they men women or children
let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life a life that will restore to them their freedom their security and above all their dignity
madam president the group of the european people s party is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report and i would like to congratulate the rapporteurs the commission and the council on this agreement
ladies and gentlemen in the nineteen eightys we coined the phrase democratic deficit '
by this we meant that in the european union decisions were taken only by the council of ministers based on commission proposals and that parliament was only consulted
parliament has been battling since the nineteen eightys through the treaties of maastricht amsterdam and nice the constitutional treaty and the treaty of lisbon
that democratic deficit and i believe that through the treaty of lisbon with parliament s new powers and the participation of national parliaments we have achieved that objective
we are adding to that achievement today through this citizens initiative which in the work of the convention was due to the sound cooperation between the national parliaments and the european parliament
i would like to recall the following names here today jürgen meyer our german social democrat colleague and alain lamassoure who were responsible for bringing this initiative to the plenary of the convention and getting it approved
i therefore believe that we have completed the circle madam president
i believe that today when we adopt this initiative we will have signed the death warrant of the idea of a democratic deficit '
now it is up to us to act responsibly ladies and gentlemen and today we also have the opportunity to do so
by adopting the union budget we will be fulfilling the role that is expected of us as a responsible parliament with codecision powers
ladies and gentlemen i think that this is a good day for europe
mr president in january twenty twelve four hundred spanish egg producers could disappear which is around thirty percent of the total number in my country with the loss of the production of three hundred thousand tonnes of eggs
the european union could stop producing the eighty million eggs which amount to two million tonnes and if we do not act very intelligently the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the european union
this nineteen ninety nine directive which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased demands that we act intelligently and positively because otherwise
we will only weaken european production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the european union
this directive requires a great deal of effort from european producers as in spain alone it is understood that the cost is around e u r six hundred million it should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general
i therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the group of the european people s party to paragraph two which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by january twenty twelve
we need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the e u market which will consequently increase prices for consumers
we need to respect the directive give the egg and egg products industries a chance and also respect the right to animal welfare and the right of consumers to a reasonable price
mr president i think it is right to congratulate the rapporteurs especially mrs grossetête and mrs roth behrendt from my own group on the work they have done to take a stagnant piece of legislation and make it useful because it has enabled the right to public health to be included as a legal basis and has provided a new direction to enable us to lay the foundations for guaranteeing citizens the safety and quality that they always choose more importantly their work
take a stagnant piece of legislation and make it useful because it has enabled the right to public health to be included as a legal basis and has provided a new direction to enable us to lay the foundations for guaranteeing citizens the safety and quality that they always choose more importantly their work has also meant that the role of the member states of origin that have to pay and of those in which treatment is received can be clearly regulated
i do not however believe that we should be satisfied with this alone but rather that it should be the beginning of a much greater step forward so that as mrs roth behrendt was saying this directive becomes just a formality because the level of equality achieved in all member states means it is unnecessary for each citizen to be returned to their country
in this battle what we need to achieve is legislation that guarantees citizens rights in relation to the care they should receive benefits and safety rather than just the right that they already have to mobility between member states
it is quality that will create union otherwise we will be taking very small steps
madam president the spanish delegation from the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament voted in favour like the rest of our group but i would not be happy to leave here without making clear my concern regarding the issue of organ transplants being included in this directive
the issue of organ transplants being included in this directive they have been included against the judgment of the committee on the environment public health and food safety as a result of the council s stubborn determination to include transplants in this directive
i hope that their inclusion does not undermine the effectiveness of the sound legislation that we adopted in this house in other words the directive on transplants or the action plan that was adopted very recently almost unanimously
i would like to say that we will be vigilant in ensuring that the inclusion of transplants does not undermine the excellent work done by such successful organisations as the spanish national transplants organisation and of course the aspiration to save twenty thousand lives that we had both in the directive on transplants and in the action plan which i repeat we adopted here
i would therefore like to make this clear and say that we will continue to ensure that the directive is complied with in this respect
mr president today is also european sexual health day
ladies and gentlemen the statistics are worrying the world health organisation estimates that more than three hundred million people involuntarily contract a sexually transmitted disease every year
in europe as the european sexual health forum warns there is a worrying increase in unwanted pregnancies among teenagers due to a major lack of education and information among our young people as the commission says there are even
as the commission says there are even several distinct inequalities in terms of access to sexual health services between the member states and within them between citizens levels of income
in order to combat all of this we need a european strategy
only five member states have plans in this area but all of them have succeeded in reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies the number of sexually transmitted disease infections and also the number of abortions
we need a common strategy focused on prevention through education that expands information policies increases family planning efforts and facilitates access to contraception
we need a cross cutting ambitious strategy with no taboos in order guarantee the rights of all europeans to the best possible sexual health and safety
mr president at a time of major social tension we can only warmly welcome the major social dialogue agreement in spain between the government the unions and employers
this agreement is a model for europe because there has not been such a milestone in a long time
we should also pay close attention to the thoughts of cándido méndez one of the principle figures in the spanish agreement who attended the meeting of the economic and social council on tuesday eight february in brussels
at that meeting mr méndez stressed the need to extend the dialogue to european level and for unions to have a voice and initiative in this europe of ours
that is how it should be
mr president while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far i have observed that unfortunately e u action is driven by emergency situations such as a serious
attack or a mass landing of immigrants as is currently happening in lampedusa where the exodus of tunisians to the italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold
the voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say enough is enough with sufficient authority
when it happens we will throw up our hands in horror but the following day we will forget about it
europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth that the mediterranean strategy is not working that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until european countries commit to equipping the european agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders with sufficient resources to be effective
talking does not cost anything but we need to act
do you really believe that frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the european borders
i do not believe it is
let us hope that the people of egypt tunisia and other countries of the maghreb do not decide to seek a better future in europe but rather that they do so in their own countries because that is what they have fought for and we must help them
solidarity and responsibility are therefore required along with above all truth when talking about a common european immigration policy which is now more necessary than ever
madam president it has already been said that the backbone of pension systems in europe is and must continue to be the public system because it is the only system that guarantees cohesion and moreover reduces the risk of poverty in our society
it is nevertheless striking that in the countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development the greatest levels of equality in terms of income are found in pensions or that due to the crisis private pensions lost twenty percent of their value in two thousand eight alone and are currently still far from meeting the required levels of solvency
all of this shows that at a time of unavoidable reforms measures to ensure the sustainability of our pension systems must be cross cutting taking into account among other factors ambitious policies concerning birth rates and balancing work and family life
ambitious policies for ensuring that people can enter and remain in employment or even immigration policies based on integration which also guarantee the sustainability of our pensions from a demographic point of view
finally i find it regrettable that the text does not place limits on the abuse of the concept of grants in businesses because as a general rule they are exempt from any social contributions
in my view this is essential for a whole new generation of workers as if more is being required of them in order to have a decent pension they should also not have to suffer so much in order to access decent employment
mr president commissioner this is a key moment in the construction of future cohesion policy which after the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon is based not only on social and economic aspects but also on territorial factors
territorial cohesion seeks harmonious development between territories so that their citizens can benefit fully from their singularities
however to achieve this objective it is also necessary to make progress in the field of cooperation between regions of the european union that are facing the same challenges and the same problems
this is the objective of the european strategy for the atlantic region a common perspective for tackling the common challenges faced by the member states of the region including marine research maritime monitoring and environmental and economic challenges
to achieve our objectives it is necessary to adopt a focused and integrated strategy which is in line with the europe twenty twenty strategy and with the policies of the european union for the post twenty thirteen period in particular with regional and maritime policy
however ladies and gentlemen this strategy must be founded above all on reformed multi level governance based on closer participation by the public authorities
both regional and local the member states the european union private sector stakeholders and civil society organisations including inter regional networks and organisations
madam president today is a very significant day to talk about equality between men and women because we are celebrating international women s day remembering those who fought for women s working and economic rights and their right to vote one hundred years ago
we have made considerable progress in those one hundred years but much remains to be done true equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life
i believe that every one of us both men and women can do a lot more to achieve true emancipation for women there are many women in the world whose right to life is being threatened whose dignity is being violated and whose freedom is being denied
allow me on this international women s day to demonstrate my support and hope to all women fighting for their democratic rights in the revolution in north africa
women cannot be worth half what men are in arab counties or anywhere in the world
we are worth the same and deserve the same
i will continue fighting to achieve that equality and international women s day will continue to exist until it is achieved
even if there are many who do not want to see it the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children
i must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in parliament and i promise to continue working toward that of course
mr president i would like to say that i agree with the opinion of the members who have spoken here this morning and who insist on respect for parliament and for the commission
this is why my modest vote in favour will depend on whether the european council is prepared to accept the role of these institutions
this is because the new mechanisms we are talking about must be a significant component in economic governance driven by a european union
capable of ensuring coherence between common economic policy which must set clear precise and limited objectives and this stability instrument
in other words we must ensure at all costs that this effort we are involved in does not end up going down the intergovernmental route which is a blind alley or one dominated by just a few countries because that would obstruct the reform
fellow members europe is being built one brick at a time and this is one brick that will reinforce and balance this delicate building
mr president there are fundamental points that still require improvement so we have to send the report back to committee
the parliamentary passage of this report is not over therefore
the initial draft was a bad one
that is what consumers associations at national and european level told us
in particular i have a high opinion of the asturias consumers union and its president the tireless dacio alonso
we have managed to have the old article four s general principle of the maximum possible harmonisation reconsidered
we must state very loudly that establishing the maximum possible harmonisation across the member states would reduce the protection of many consumers since in many countries there is a greater tradition of protecting consumer rights
in any case i should like to stress that it is essential to ensure that the list of unfair contract terms not be exhaustive meaning that each member state could increase the number of clauses that it considers unacceptable and invalid in contracts with consumers
in contracts with consumers that the burden of proof be reversed so that it becomes the trader that has to demonstrate that terms outside the norm have been negotiated individually and that contract terms be expressed in a clear and comprehensible way
we remain opposed to the establishment of the maximum possible harmonisation as regards unfair terms
eurobarometer indicates that seventy nine percent of traders believe that full harmonisation in this field will have little or no effect on their foreign activities
mr president commissioner please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur mr schwab and mrs gebhardt on the work they have done
i have a general thought
it is not that protectionism is increasing but rather that it is a case of not removing rights that already exist in some of the member states
this is because if we want to set up a genuine internal market for relationships between companies and consumers and are pursuing that we must
establish at the same time a balance between a high level of protection for consumer rights and defence of companies competitiveness
this balance involves agreeing on a minimum level of harmonisation as well as the possibility of allowing the member states to keep or adopt any additional regulations that improve consumer protection
we cannot allow the adoption of e u legislation to mean that many consumers and users end up with less protection
i welcome the fact that negotiations in the european parliament have improved but i should like to insist that already established rights not be removed
mr president many experts are saying that the next crisis could be an energy crisis and that moreover we are not doing what is necessary to prevent it or that we are not doing it fast enough to prevent it
the world wide fund for nature is calling for all of us to make a small gesture toward sustainability this saturday
many europeans will turn out their lights for an hour and many public administrations too
that is not enough
europe cannot remain dependent on energy sources that do not belong to it and are far away or on unsecure energy sources
we must help the member states to build an energy model in which renewable energy sources are the heart of the new mix
we must also help to raise awareness of new patterns of consumption because without any doubt renewable energy and efficiency are the keys to future sustainability
finally i should like to call on all the member states of the union to join the call the desire of five member states including spain to reduce c o emissions by a further thirty percent that way we would demonstrate that europe as well as being a leader in terms of freedom and rights is also a leader in terms of its commitment to the planet s sustainability
mr president on most occasions that i have spoken in parliament it has been to denounce violence against women and i am here again to combat it
i must say that not only do i not tire of doing this but i think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board furthermore this parliament is the best
loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us as legislators to compel the member states to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime and also to provide assistance to the victims
when according to estimates one in four women in europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life and the same proportion of children i believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment as has been recognised by the commission in its action plan
i believe that we must keep on insisting time and time again in order to protect victims as we did with the european protection order for which i was rapporteur and i hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible
this report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset this shows that when we tackle domestic violence which affects all family members including children the
family members including children the elderly women and men this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society
the first thing we must do is to speak up and the second is to get down to work for although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths
we must be doing something wrong and therefore it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions we must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety
i want all the victims to know that i shall always be here to speak up for them until the day that by working together we manage to defeat this
that by working together we manage to defeat this terrible enemy which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims what i say is we have had enough
mr president commissioner thank you for your words and i agree with you that we must listen to our citizens and restore their faith in the european project
today could therefore be a great day for europe and european social integration
this is because with the adoption of these reports we are not only moving towards the revival of the single market a key element in tackling the current economic crisis but also responding to the demands of citizens who wish to move towards a larger europe and strengthen social rights
europe must respond to new global challenges turning the european economy into a highly competitive social market economy and stimulating noticeable growth with more and better jobs
however this goal should be based on the insertion of a social clause in all legislation related to the internal market making citizens the focal point of our attention and priority thereby strengthening their social rights
finally i would ask the commission to present these proposals as soon as possible
mr president bluetongue has been a constant threat to our livestock and hence to public health
hitherto we used an activated vaccine to fight this disease the use of which entails the need to restrict the movement of animals to certain areas in order to prevent the virus from spreading to non infected animals
use of the vaccine use of vaccination was therefore limited to areas where infected animals had been detected in the past this was detrimental to the farmers affected who suffered on two accounts firstly because of the disease and secondly because of the restrictions
all these problems can apparently be avoided through use of a new inactivated vaccine which in addition to preventing potential disturbances in the internal livestock market will also enable the development of new further reaching which is what really matters prevention strategies for combating this disease
it is therefore vital for the livestock industry that we amend the directive to allow the use of this vaccine and that we do this as soon as possible
ladies and gentlemen adherence to our treaties particularly as regards correlation tables should not be an excuse for not bringing this regulation into force before the summer such a delay would only cause further damage to farmers
mr president i would firstly like to express my gratitude to the committee on petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the spanish federation of associations of producers and exporters of fruits vegetables flowers and live plants based on the report published by o l a f the european anti fraud office in two thousand seven
i believe this report s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the european commission which should have addressed this matter a long time ago to clarify the operation of the entry price regime at least in relation to the tomato sector
however not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current entry price regulation the commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place
ladies and gentlemen it is time for the european commission to take its responsibilities seriously to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed and potentially to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties
i believe that there is no way that a new agreement with morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved
our aim is not to hinder new international agreements but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of european producers and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to
where the new agreement with morocco is concerned all the european fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will in fact be observed this will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime
we cannot have a new agreement with morocco until we have a new system for entry prices
we will not be able to ratify the agreement that the commission has already concluded
moreover if this supervisory role is to be played by the member states they should be required to make a significant financial contribution however it is also true that we have long been calling for a european borders and customs system similar to that of the united states so as to ensure effective control
mr president commissioner dealing with this european parliament report has been complicated mainly because it has involved measures requiring approval from the world trade organisation so the preliminary draft that the commission sent to parliament is different to that sent to geneva
we think it is necessary to help pakistan we believe that exceptionally trade preferences can be conceded provided that they take into account the sensitivity of
european industry and in particular of the textile industry which is suffering badly from the consequences of the crisis in regions like the community of valencia in spain
however this report has enabled us to verify that measures that can be taken within the framework of international trade probably cannot be dealt with as urgently as these acts require so we should learn for the future
us help pakistan yes not however with the commission s original proposal as it does not take into account the effects on european industry as regards implementation deadlines for sensitive products and
even delay the implementation of these measures because it is not the same as the text awaiting w t o approval we would miss the deadline
we therefore consider it unacceptable to keep this proposal and we think that we will have to vote against it
mr president i should like to start my speech by congratulating all those who have made it possible to reach an agreement
it is a report that we should all welcome because it affects the day to day lives of all members of the public but in the constructive spirit characteristic of me i should like to point out a few things
to begin with i should like to draw attention to the importance of providing consumers with information that is precise and relevant but above all comprehensible and uniform
consumers with information that is precise and relevant but above all comprehensible and uniform regarding the components of textile products exhaustive information is useless if the public is then unable to decipher it
we have achieved a step forward that is necessary but not enough we must make further progress and protect the most vulnerable members of the public
ladies and gentlemen it is essential to establish a european size labelling system based on body measurements because the first thing we look for when we go to buy clothes is the size
we must therefore be much more ambitious and seek the harmonisation of sizes
mr president i should like to briefly raise three points on the current situation concerning cucumbers
i am the grandson of a german and feel deep affection for that country but the german authorities have clearly acted hastily and rashly in this particular case
as for the e u institutions an analysis of their actions reveals that the european food safety authority and the commission reacted feebly and clumsily they have failed to coordinate or to manage the situation
thirdly the injured parties are entitled to rapid financial compensation
in the meantime however i propose to parliament that we hold a great show of european gastronomy either in brussels or here in strasbourg allowing cucumber to take centre stage
we must vindicate the lost honour an expression much to the taste of the german author heinrich böll of cucumber producers
europe is the right stage for this purpose
mr president one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the twenty three fatalities twenty two in germany and one in sweden
this crisis is clear evidence that the european union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination
the member states involved have been slow inefficient and inoperative in their reaction and at this point in time with twenty three people dead we still do not know where the problem is coming from
the european commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now these lead to cases of financial ruin the destruction of previously stable jobs unemployment helplessness and needless to say an extremely hazardous public health crisis while you in the commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in germany statements that were
stable jobs unemployment helplessness and needless to say an extremely hazardous public health crisis while you in the commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in germany statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible
authorities in germany statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible mentioning spanish farms by their names and addresses the population remained exposed without knowing it to the bacterium thus in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food
in the council of agriculture ministers that will be held in luxembourg at two o clock this afternoon the european commission should propose that a portion of the e u r twenty five hundred million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use
those e u r twenty five hundred million should be used to redress in so far as is possible the damage that has been caused
to enable this a suitable legal solution will need to be found as was the case in previous instances for example the mad cow and dioxin affairs one such solution should also be found now
commissioners ministers your actions in luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office
furthermore the german authorities in view of their reckless accusations should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products which is now in shatters
mr president commissioner nothing that we do here or in the european union is going to bring the dead back to life but i hope that what is being done will prevent more deaths and halt the chain of people who are ill and who are suffering without having done anything to cause the problem
certainly we do not know the causes but we do know some things that we have to spell out there has been negligence in political action and negligence by the german federal government it cannot act as if hamburg were a city state on another continent
if mrs merkel and her ministry of health had translated the arrogance with which they frequently address other states into diligence and efficiency some of the things that happened would not have done so
that negligence has had criminal consequences for one state namely spain and for its most important sector agriculture it has ruined thousands of people and small businesses and has discredited the economy for a long time
i ask you to go to the council today and ask for full compensation for those affected because we cannot ask for life for those who have died
and i ask for the control systems to be reviewed
and for mrs merkel to accept responsibility
and i ask her for less arrogance and more diligence
and that she be held responsible for the damage she has caused
she cannot ignore the fact that hamburg is in her country
she cannot ignore her responsibilities
she cannot attribute blame to a federal state when she herself should be held responsible for the damage caused
a bit more humility a bit more good management and a little less conservatism would have gone a long way to ensuring that this crisis did not slip through her hands and that spain and other farmers in the south did not have to suffer its painful consequences
review the controls review the warning systems and ask for responsibility because commissioner in spain we are asking you the council and germany for precisely this
mr president we are faced with a public health problem an epidemic according to the commissioner and they have been looking for those culpable and not the cause
the system has not worked we have twenty two dead sixteen hundred affected and three weeks later we still do not know the cause and using the precautionary principle without scientific basis i repeat without scientific basis spain is being blamed
ladies and gentlemen spanish cucumbers were not contaminated
they were not contaminated i am repeating it because some versions to the contrary have been heard here
moreover so that you can see the impact that these words have had three hundred thousand jobs may be affected a loss of confidence
an epidemic knows no frontiers
i am telling you commissioner knows no frontiers we ask for responsibility for what has not been done for what we have to do immediately because there is a risk of further infection in germany at the moment it has the largest number of people affected but spain is not to blame
we ask for compensation
mr president the most important thing and that which is uniting us here today are the victims because nobody should feel as unprotected as we the european consumers feel at the moment
furthermore we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims
it is my responsibility to denounce the german authorities who wrongly and hastily accused spanish cucumbers and more specifically the cooperatives of malaga and almeria which were model operations and which will not recover from these accusations
thousands of jobless families are wondering why and they need an answer and in particular they want to know what the future holds for them not just in andalusia but throughout european agriculture
therefore and in the hope that the experts will soon find the solution i demand that today when the commission speaks to the council it asks for immediate and moral economic measures for all the producers from andalusia and from the whole of europe who are looking towards us with indignation but also with hope
mr president instead of giving priority to the european investigation and cooperation the german authorities have slandered and prejudiced cucumber producers and others
yet nobody in germany has resigned or offered reparations for the damage caused
it is germany that has a serious credibility problem
the treatment by mrs merkel of the southern countries both with regard to agriculture and finance is intolerable
someone said that mrs merkel was a disciple of adenauer and kohl
she is nothing of the sort she lacks moral fibre
mr president it is no coincidence that spain italy greece ireland portugal and other countries are all reluctant to accept the so called eurovignette
this common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since at the end of the day it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the member states enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the european union who will collect it
the reasoning that underlies the eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day
even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion just as the old polluter pays principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way
in addition to this ladies and gentlemen only fifteen percent of the funds collected through the eurovignette which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures will finally be used to fund trans european networks and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation thus finance
finally be used to fund trans european networks and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation thus finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries within the wide sphere of infrastructures
the ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport which the way things stand today is the only means enabling the operation of the internal market
this is reality ladies and gentlemen a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis
if european products are to be competitive in global markets we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak european economy by imposing yet more additional costs
lastly the food crisis which has recklessly been blamed on spanish products has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the eurovignette freight carriers and prime crop farmers
it is for all these reasons ladies and gentlemen that the spanish delegation of the european people s party shall vote against this draft directive
ladies and gentlemen as i take the chair for this sitting all of you will understand if i express to you my sorrow and consternation at the death of jorge semprún which took place a few hours ago at the age of eighty seven
in jorge semprún we celebrate someone who was imprisoned in buchenwald concentration and extermination camp someone who fought nazi forces in france and the franco dictatorship in my country spain
we also celebrate the outstanding politically committed writer who collaborated in particular on our european book prize programme and the reassured pro european politician
i mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and i am going to ask president buzek to send his family and the spanish government a message of heartfelt condolence and support which i am sure that all of us here share
mr president we aspire to the creation of an economic government area subject to the principles of federalism albeit adapted to the process of european integration
we can no longer close our eyes to the situation
there is an inconsistency in having a common currency but lacking the fiscal and financial instruments needed alongside it
specifically we need the issuance of common european bonds the outright rejection of competition between the bonds issued by the different member states the establishment of a genuinely european treasury and the
harmonisation of fiscal policies to ensure equality combat tax fraud and help to define a progressive european social policy based on efficient public services
some may say these ideas are elementary
they must nonetheless be repeated time and again because nobody listens to them
it is for this very reason that is to say not listening that we are living in dark times as anticipated by the poet bertolt brecht
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the current economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing highlights the need for regional policy as the best means of reducing disparities in development between regions and member states
at the same time we can restore the positive image of europe which recently citizens associate only with tough adjustment programmes and spending cuts
future cohesion policy the pillar of solidarity of the european project and of social justice must take into account the following priorities firstly reinforcing social cohesion and incorporating the challenges posed by the europe twenty twenty strategy secondly providing for the needs and geographical characteristics
geographical characteristics of the regions especially the most disadvantaged regions thirdly maintaining a gradual approach to the collection of funds so that the regions do not abandon the objective of convergence avoiding sudden changes in the receipt of aid and fourthly promoting an equitable system

finally ladies and gentlemen the authorities are applying harsh fiscal adjustment policies
therefore e u support is necessary
i hope that the council will take note of this
mr president in defence of fundamental rights i call on the responsible institutions to review the designation of san sebastián as european capital of culture because i believe that it was chosen on the basis of political criteria which constitutes discrimination against the other candidate cities
the chairman of the panel said the city was chosen to support the peace process but as far as i am aware there is a terrorist organisation in spain called e t a that so far has not laid down its weapons and which two months ago managed to get its political wing bildu into government in san sebastián as well as other towns
i do not believe that europe should be giving such a powerful megaphone to people who fail to condemn terrorist violence and who will create propaganda out of apportioning blame between victims and murderers
where is the right to freedom and dignity
clearly not in san sebastián where our fellow members such as mayor oreja mr iturgaiz mr zalba and i myself have to go around with bodyguards
i believe in the culture of life not in a bullet to the back of the head
ladies and gentlemen can there be any true culture without freedom
no a thousand times no
san sebastián should once again submit its candidacy when it is a city that is free for everyone
in the meantime they should learn the culture of respect towards those who think differently because although the city may deserve the title in future today with batasuna and its successors in its institutions it does not
mr president firstly i would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the fruitful help they have given me in drafting this report
i would also like to extend the same comments to the other members fellow members from the parliamentary committee
sixty years ago the european coal and steel community was created and there is no better way of commemorating this event now than by discussing energy infrastructures in europe
today the objectives of the european union s policy are clear the common european internal market the drive for renewable energy as a means of or instrument for fighting against climate change security of energy supply and diversification of energy sources
in the treaty of lisbon one title title x x i is devoted to energy and it sets out the commitments that i have just mentioned as well as endorsing the interconnection of energy grids
well the goal of the report we have drafted is to improve those energy infrastructures that in the opinion of the european commission are outdated and poorly interconnected
for example the generation of wind energy in the north sea and baltic sea is increasing spectacularly and with the immense renewable energy potential in southern europe and north africa we find ourselves
europe and north africa we find ourselves up against problems relating to large scale electricity storage and the recharging needs of electric vehicles as well as many other urgent issues
it is impossible to tackle all of this if we do not design new grids and new connections both within the european union and in third countries
this is why in coming years we will have to make progress in determining the infrastructure we need a establishing the criteria that will make it possible to select projects that are of interest to europe
b eliminating energy islands ' c ensuring that these projects are carried out within reasonable timescales and mediating to find ways of resolving the conflict ridden subject of authorisation and permit procedures
of authorisation and permit procedures in the member states and d ensuring funding that will attract and stimulate private investment without prejudice to whatever public support may be necessary
energy efficiency and saving as well as smart grids are pivotal ingredients in the new kind of design contained in the report because we
because we believe that by reducing energy demand we can reduce our dependency on imports which will have a knock on effect on our infrastructure requirements
the fundamental concern of this report from the very outset has been the processing of permits and authorisations to enable the required work to be carried out
at the moment projects drag on endlessly
this happens due to people s opposition to seeing turbines or other kinds of facilities springing up in their neighbourhoods
we feel that this conflict could be solved by providing early public information and setting up a warning system for cases in which a country s authorities do not deal with an application within a reasonable amount of time
we are up against ambitious objectives and this calls for everyone to be involved
in this regard the industry companies who are rightly calling out for a stable regulatory framework as the best way of assuring financing for their efforts are of fundamental importance
until now the european union s energy policy both outside and within its borders has lacked any decisively european impetus
europe must speak with one voice which must be clearly audible and ring out loudly in the vaults of the european building because it is our very energy fragility that must give us the strength to build a europe that is solid and vigorous in terms of
to build a europe that is solid and vigorous in terms of energy and a worthy successor in this anniversary year to the great invention of the european coal and steel community which was our very origin
mr president each time there is a compromise that allows us to move forward we must be pleased however i do not believe that the compromise we have reached will make us die from an attack of happiness either
we must be careful about the raptures of happiness we are experiencing
it is true that we have moved forward especially with regard to food labelling and with regard to safety in terms of the clarity of the message however we have come up short on trans fats for example in terms of the obligation to label them
i want to ask the commission not to allow the time limits to run out
in a well supplied continent such as this with problems of over eating cardiac issues and obesity we must speed up and consider as soon as possible a prohibition on trans fats being added to food as denmark and australia have done and as spain is doing
this must be done without delay and without waiting any longer
the compromises are going to depend on the urgency with which we apply ourselves the clarity with which we conduct ourselves and how ambitious we are
we cannot remain in a haze of happiness at what we have done it is good but it is nothing to jump up and down about
we must make more progress and be more precise above all in the areas that i have mentioned
mr president i would like to say to everyone that there is only one kind of terrorism simply that which destroys innocent lives where it comes from is not an issue
the victims of terrorism whom i represent given that the e t a terrorist organisation killed my brother and his wife share a common thread and on their behalf
i would like to say that this report with such a long title could have been ambitious but it is not
it is a disappointing outcome
this report does not represent us it does not represent hopes for justice or the balance between freedom and security that we talk about so much here
it does not represent us and i believe that a report on terrorism should acknowledge the victims of terrorism but this does not
therefore i ask you to vote against this report
− madam president confidence is what the european companies and economy needs
audit companies are currently weighed down by a concentration and lack of independence of auditors and they do not help to generate the much desired confidence to get our economy going again
a proposal for eliminating the legal obligation for account auditing cannot be ruled out
why not
if we want to recover the confidence of the markets and market stability we must carry out a deep reform of the audits so that they provide genuine added value and not merely a legal burden
the big auditing firms use auditing services as a business card for their future customers
once familiar with the company they offer more burdensome additional services through which they often compensate for the low prices of auditing itself
we have a price distortion problem within the sector
these additional services already comprise almost fifty percent of turnover which is why the big auditing firms do not wish to lose the auditing services not for the auditing itself but rather to maintain and increase the additional services
the second major obstacle to free competition in the sector is the oligopoly comprised of the four big firms that account for over ninety percent of the european market
as an oligopoly they control prices and place barriers against new competition using intangible ideas such as the brand s international image
it is true that this brand image can provide advantages but it does not always mean greater efficiency given the legislative diversity in terms of accounting statements liable to be processed in a special way in each member state
i share the aims of the green paper in terms of the independence and deconcentration of the sector and the means to be used rotation group audits
rotation group audits tendering fortifying professional scepticism prevalence of substance over form and the separation of auditing services from non auditing services
i have tried to apply them to my report within what is permitted by the parliamentary majorities and the report s modest reach
ladies and gentlemen this is nothing more than a small step towards achieving new legislation that rights the wrongs in the audit sector which have led us to this terrible economic crisis
good luck mr barnier may you continue along this path and achieve a good result
mr president we are all part of a whole and nobody can survive alone
this emergency requires a joint effort and sacrifice
it is now being demanded that the union show leadership and that the mechanisms for governing and decision making function in real time
the monetary union cannot survive without unambiguous political leadership
it needs economic governance a common budget a certain level of fiscal harmonisation and an emergency plan
therefore we first need to regulate public accounts correct macroeconomic imbalances and stimulate competitiveness
no country should spend more than its economic growth allows
on the other hand the intergovernmental nature of the financial stability mechanism is regrettable
the european union needs a permanent crisis resolution mechanism under the community method a european monetary fund
if europe wants to see leadership ladies and gentlemen then those decisions must be driven by parliament and the commission rather than by the council which is hindered and slowed down by the national governments
it is the responsibility of member states to do their homework in order to help with the decisions of the union as a whole and to do all they can to succeed in this vital task achieve economic growth and create employment
more than one year ago in spain the leader of the popular party mr rajoy expressed his support in the spanish parliament for a specific amendment to our constitution
moreover just last week the spanish parliament and senate reached an agreement on the matter after prime minister zapatero gave his formal support
the commitment to cleaning up public accounts cannot be an interim measure ladies and gentlemen it has to be permanent
mr president i am a municipal councillor in a small village in central spain while it is true that the tourist industry is an opportunity for the entire european union it is much more markedly so for
rural areas like ours for three reasons firstly because it diversifies the economy bringing a new opportunity for women and young people and is also a policy that can prevent depopulation in our rural areas secondly because these activities also
fully complement the activities of the primary sector and even strengthen them in the case of agritourism and thirdly because unlike in the coastal sector seasonality is not as high which can also mean new longer lasting better quality jobs
i would therefore like to stress that this report should not make the mistake of setting a european strategy based once again on the coastal or urban sector rural areas should be a priority particularly in terms of competitiveness investment training
innovation the adoption of excellence as its standard consistency in quality criteria and greater visibility furthermore rural tourism should be taken into account across each and every one of the commission s actions
thus i would like to congratulate the commission and the rapporteur for this initiative and this report
madam president the subject we are discussing is crucial even at this late hour absorption of the structural funds and the
structural funds and the cohesion fund must be optimised in order to maximise the contribution of the available regional policy resources to social and economic cohesion
we need to correct the main factors causing absorption problems and foster increased simplicity and flexibility in the rules and procedures access to european funds for project organisers and good management of these funds by the administrative services
we should also pursue and penalise fraud instead of focusing on minor formal irregularities and encourage greater synergy and complementarity between the different funds
lastly i should specifically like to stress the importance of attaining maximum efficiency in the execution of the european social fund so that an adequate response may be given to challenges we are currently seeing in the area of employment stemming from the financial recession
ladies and gentlemen we need to recover a sense of direction for the european project because europe can be built on necessity but it also requires ambition
mr president this morning the president of the commission mr barroso brought this subject up in the debate on the state of the union
that gives us an idea of the importance the commission affords this issue
he spoke about hope inclusion and solidarity
at a time of economic crisis such as this when there are ever more unemployed people and ever more people living close to the poverty line this deadlock shown by some member states is the most absolute example of a lack of solidarity
those countries that are opposed the richest of the european union may endanger the continuation of a programme that with one percent of the common agricultural policy budget helps eighteen million people
the commissioner is right to shame those council members who are incapable of showing solidarity at this time
i urge the polish presidency between now and the end of its term to continue with its support in order to move forward with this programme
it deserves that
so do all the people who need it and the e u also deserves that vote of confidence and above all that response to its citizens
the e u council of ministers should take into account parliament s view that the programme should not only be maintained but also improved as this house called for yesterday
i would also like to remind the heads of state or government that we hope and trust that at the next summit they will take these matters seriously and find a political way out of this deadlock
madam president commissioner as you know in two thousand eight parliament roundly rejected the motion for a resolution that was presented to it
later in the same terms the report that i myself presented to the chamber was approved by a comfortable majority with a great consensus and with the effort of the commission and the political groups
what were the reasons behind parliament s change of mind
undoubtedly seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled including the preservation of fundamental rights and among these in particular the passenger s dignity and privacy non discrimination protection of personal data and protection of health
in this way we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers security on the one hand and preserving their rights in full on the other
the scanners will not use ionising radiation they will not be mandatory for member states nor for citizens and they will all protect the rights described above
true the commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but in addition to scanners that use stick figures it includes the possibility of another type which whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights permits the inspection of an image of the passenger albeit blurred
we accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control
parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation
however today we call on the commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights
moreover we encourage it to work with industry and the member states in order to ensure that in the near future only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image
madam president our british colleagues in the house of commons in keeping with their country s historical parliamentary and democratic tradition that is so admirable have highlighted the intolerable practices of the murdoch media group
the courage shown by newspaper is also commendable
however rupert murdoch s aberrant tentacles reach even further than that
his payroll includes the former prime minister of spain josé maría aznar who commands a six figure sum and is still very keen to maintain his influence over spanish and indeed european politics
an election campaign is about to begin in spain
campaign gets under way the popular party and its leader mr rajoy should make clear to the european people what form of support they receive from mr murdoch and his group what it is that the
demands in exchange for his financial support of mr aznar and his foundation and whether or not that plot has anything to do with what has taken place in the united kingdom now revealed so laudably
madam president as rapporteur of the report on the drafting of a directive on the rights of victims of crimes including terrorism and as a spaniard who has personally suffered the cruelty of the terrorist organisation e t a i would like to thank president buzek for his support for my country and its victims
i understand the pleasure that many people feel at this new statement from e t a but i must remind you that it is still too soon to celebrate because they have not yet handed over their weapons nor disbanded nor asked their victims for forgiveness
ladies and gentlemen it is also important for you to realise that we do not have to reach any kind of peace between the two sides in spain because there has not been a war
my brother alberto jiménez becerril who was murdered by e t a along with his wife in seville was not returning from war he was going home where his three children who would never see him again were waiting for him
we have the obligation to tell my brother s children that his parents were better than their murderers
if we accept an end without winners or losers we will be showing these children that you can achieve political objectives by killing
so i ask parliament not to allow itself to be hoodwinked by the e t a terrorists and their accomplices and to listen to the sincere voices of the victims the only thing they want is the peace that comes from justice
madam president arcelormittal s strategy and tactics have to be overcome
i have always been against allowing this predatory and relocation businessman mr mittal into europe
commissioner do not allow the social barbarity of mr mittal and his directors who have already made huge profits through the arcelor stock options
take a stand commissioner in the name of europe its workers and its people take a stand against mr mittal once and for all
congratulations on your forthcoming fatherhood mr stoyanov
we have reached the end of the catch the eye session with this speech in a debate that i think has been one of the most fascinating that i have ever chaired
i am sure my male colleagues will not be offended if i say that whenever our female colleagues are in the majority in speaking the debates are usually extremely interesting
i am going to give the floor to the president in office of the council radoslaw mleczko so that he can conclude with his response to the speeches that have been made on this important issue in their entirety
− mr president the governments of the member states are unwilling to give a joint response to the situation of war and deep social and political transformation currently taking place just across our borders
contrary to my report on the reception conditions of asylum seekers they continue to insist on systematically incarcerating refugees people who have had to flee their countries precisely because they stood up for freedom our freedom as well as theirs as they are both inseparable
holding refugees in custody is both expensive and unjust it prevents them from overcoming the traumatic experiences they have lived through it criminalises people
have lived through it criminalises people who have suffered crimes against humanity and it is a waste of public money
let us take a different course of action making use of alternatives to custody
in a world that is becoming increasingly bipolar and with an ailing economy europe is doomed to indifference and failure
let us reinvigorate our values
i fully go along with the questions that my colleague and great friend rui tavares has raised here today
mr president mr barroso mr van rompuy ladies and gentlemen this crisis is teaching us many things but there is one lesson that i think is especially important and it is this the treaties will need to be amended in the future
the treaties will need to be amended in the future to overhaul the decision making process and how agreements are adopted within the european institutions
the diabolical system currently in place is slow frustrating and what is more full of vagaries
these flaws lead us to inaction and in some cases paralysis and economic ruin is never far behind paralysis
i will say it time and time again from my humble seat a federal state can work either well or poorly but a confederation never works
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen people want europe to find solutions to their problems they want europe to be able to bring about sustainable economic recovery and to help make regulations simpler and more flexible
mobility is not only a fundamental right of professionals enshrined in the treaties it is also a key factor involved in modernisation of the employment market and economic development
this is why the system for recognising professional qualifications needs to be updated and adapted to the current employment situation and the demands and needs of professionals and consumers
the commission s future proposal must make provision for simpler and more transparent rules for recognising professional qualifications it must evaluate compensation measures in order to resolve current problems make
the criteria regarding linguistic skills clearer to ensure the quality of services provided and protect consumer and patient safety and bring about greater cooperation and coordination between the competent authorities and national points of contact
ladies and gentlemen europe must put professionals and consumers at the heart of the single market
it is only in this way that we will be able to build a way out of the financial and economic crisis based on sustainable knowledge and social progress
mr president ladies and gentlemen we are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue
firstly we must take into account cultural traditions as well as the important sustainable contribution that betting makes to society in some countries such as mine through education culture and sport
however we must also fight the criminality associated with gambling and protect consumers especially the most vulnerable in order to prevent excessive and pathological gambling
this is why i believe that the principle of active subsidiarity based on cooperation between national governments must take precedence in this field
nevertheless we must be ambitious and focus on developing common regulations and working together in a coordinated fashion against unregulated online gambling operators which operate without the necessary national licences
we must also ensure transparency and enable non discriminatory competition that will promote public interest and consumer protection
lastly we must encourage the creation of a network of national organisations to support gambling addicts which will make it possible to exchange experiences and tried and tested practices
madam president ladies and gentlemen i would like to congratulate my friend mr kaczmarek on his good report and his generous flexibility in accepting the amendments i tabled to his initial draft
after saying that i agree with a great deal of what has been said here and the text that we will vote on tomorrow i would like to express some pleasure some concern and a few ideas on the work that parliament has done and will continue to do through the a c p e u joint parliamentary assembly
i am pleased with the work done by louis michel as co president of the assembly and by our friends in the commission led by mr piebalgs for the interest and care they have shown and their characteristically straightforward sincere and efficient participation in our work
however i am concerned that absorbed by the rest of their work in parliament our representatives are becoming noticeably absent from the joint assembly the work of which we are discussing here today
it seems clear to me that members who give priority to other concerns should take a good look at the situation
the situation and either give their work in the a c p e u assembly the importance it deserves or make way for other members who may have more time to devote to this activity
furthermore i feel that parliament itself should place more focus on this area of work and understand the political importance of the cotonou agreement which is the most representative example of north south cooperation
is the most representative example of north south cooperation involving almost eighty developing countries around the world as well as the twenty seven soon to be twenty eight member states that make up the european union
at a time when world governance needs to be coordinated on a multilateral basis our a c p partners offer enormous political potential for organising joint actions on the international stage
parliament should also pay greater attention to the resolutions that our delegates adopt with our a c p colleagues in the parliamentary assembly
we should not continue adopting all kinds of resolutions on parliament s behalf without any note being taken of these texts at least by the relevant parliamentary committees
appropriate measures should be studied to ensure that parliament knows what is being debated and adopted in the a c p e u assembly so that the texts it adopts in the same areas are consistent and do not give rise as can sometimes happen to significant discrepancies that are frankly disconcerting for our partners
mr president mr cioloş i am glad that you are here with us this morning and i hope that today you will answer me a little more seriously and a little more clearly
in the proposed reform of the common agricultural policy that you presented to us on twelve october you spoke of eliminating the sugar quota system and you also spoke about ending vine planting rights
parliament which has recently voted on the report by mr dess is in favour of continuing planting rights beyond
twenty fifteen and not liberalising them it also wants to maintain the sugar quota system until at least twenty twenty
are you going to support parliament s position and parliament s decision on these two issues
if i have understood you correctly commissioner given that there are now fifteen member states in the council that think differently as they did before and
given that parliament is continuing its commitment to vine planting rights does this mean we can be relatively optimistic about the commission s proposal next year in the wine report
commissioner thank you for the explanation but the reality right now is that the number of subsidies that valencian farmers receive is almost zero
valencian farmers do not live off subsidies
let us hope that the recognition of this aid for small farmers that you have just described to be given by the member states will clarify the current situation
mr president ms lövin s report places valuable emphasis on the fundamental issue of making a united effort to combat illegal fishing
the aims of a common policy on sustainable fishing protection of the marine environment and promotion of fishing without unfair competition will not be accomplished if we do not take a committed stand in the fight against such illegal fishing
the oceans know no boundaries so efforts must be made at both european and international level
the european union needs to have credible policies here and should impose penalties on practices like those recently publicised where community flagged vessels operate illegally in waters protected by conservation measures
the problem of illegal fishing does not only concern third country vessels but also eu flagged operators
furthermore we cannot make progress in the absence of powerful financial instruments which will make access to public money conditional on carrying out effective monitoring procedures and complying with all fishing regulations
madam president i think it is very important to closely follow the application of the european protection order
we refer to filing a report but these reports should be followed by real protection
we need troops we can approve good laws but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again
therefore it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly
that is real justice
so many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs
it is necessary therefore that we pool our efforts that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working which i believe is really necessary
i ask the member states to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation as that s what we have worked for and we consider that we have made it clear
i think that from now on the doors to victim rights are wide open in europe that women and men can count on this and other instruments which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear
today through our voices and tomorrow through our votes we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the european parliament the support that society owes them and mostly importantly justice
i can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive regardless of the crime committed against them
mr president thank you to the presidency of the council and the commission and thank you to everyone involved
however i would be lacking in sincerity if i did not add something else each of us in parliament is free to speak up for whatever interests we deem fit be they those of an industrial sector or any
of our choosing however i believe we must be honest with ourselves and with others and not conceal our defence of whatever it is we are defending by disguising it behind other names or issues
i have to say that not one of the shadow rapporteurs who have worked hard on this and some of whom like mr schlyter have even added some hints of humour which we really needed have received any complaints from any consumers association
for this reason nobody here can say that we are not providing consumers with information and nobody can try to claim that they speak for consumers interests more than the consumers associations themselves do
this is not our intention
you should read this directive again in depth and pay respect to the work done
i would also like to say a few words about three speeches those by ms ries mr kelly and ms nedelcheva which mentioned the need to promote and consume local products the truth is that the european union virtually regardless of the country of production is a powerful consumer and
consume local products the truth is that the european union virtually regardless of the country of production is a powerful consumer and producer of fruit and packaged juices we should encourage consumption of our own products as far as possible in order to reduce atmospheric c o emissions and promote european products at a time of crisis particularly in agriculture
this is why i support the three speeches that raised this issue and add my voice to them
i also accept and support the commissioner s comments about working harder to improve both quality and quantity we must do this but the union is a single entity and the place in which an item is produced is irrelevant this must also be reflected in our fruits and juices
mr schnellhardt i say this having read the directive in detail what you say is totally wrong because adding flavours of other fruits is not permitted it says that flavours must be added that are of the same species
what we could not accept is something that is technically impossible which is to compulsorily add to the juice to help goodness knows who the flavour of the very fruit being pressed
this is technically impossible when the juice is stored in four million litre tanks and you need ten thousand litres to get two litres of flavour and this should have been made clear
i genuinely and cordially invite you to read the directive in detail because if you do you will surely change your mind
madam president light more light is what goethe is said to have called for in his last moments
today the poet who was also an effective ruler would no doubt qualify these statements by calling for saving and efficiency
for in a europe poor in energy resources it is essential that we can distinguish between necessary consumption that drives the economy and superfluous consumption
we need to control the latter and to that end it is imperative to encourage drastic change in the habits of many european citizens
when we analyse the economic crisis we call for austerity and also for stimuli for growth
well fine few better spheres in which to turn those beautiful words into reality than the energy sphere where a combination of saving and the
necessary investment for large projects is required including construction of an integrated infrastructure network the report on which i had the honour of presenting to this parliament
the commission must make more tangible efforts than those made to date because it would put a bit of backbone into europe
only a sound well thought out efficient and economical european energy policy will enable europe to walk upright and in the right direction
all clarifications from the commission in this regard that i have indicated will be well received
mr president the experience of all the climate change conferences held since nineteen ninety five tells us that in their present format they are doomed to failure
they sought a global agreement and furthermore sought to arrive at it by a consensus an impossible ambition to achieve because of the very different productive economic and social structure of the states concerned
that is why in the end what they can hope to achieve are minimum threholds but clearly this is not enough
furthermore climate change is linked to other deep rooted problems in societies such as their development and education models social differences and poverty if all of these issues are to be raised at these conferences it will be
at these conferences it will be even more difficult for agreements to be reached especially if the conferences turn into fairs international exhibitions with thousands and thousands of participants which has been the case
the european union must continue to fly the flag for the environment which commissioner hedegaard did very well in durban
for that i congratulate her
these conferences mr president ladies and gentlemen need greater coherence between the states more diplomatic work and less of a festival atmosphere
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen firstly i should like to thank my colleague ms patrão neves because during the last few months she has defended against all opposition this resolution which we are debating today and which we will vote on later
ms patrão neves with the support of the group of the european people s party has had to face many obstacles and i should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point
ladies and gentlemen fifty years ago farmers received fifty percent of the final price paid by consumers but today in many cases they receive less than ten percent
at the same time in twenty years the market share for distribution chains has risen from twenty one point seven percent to seventy percent
something is going on and it is quite obvious
measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable more equal and fairer firstly the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved
we must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities i am referring to
competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities i am referring to those producers outside of the european union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality
opportunities and equal responsibilities i am referring to those producers outside of the european union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality food security animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards
where do we do all of this
well in the next c a p reform of course
we must improve contractual relations in this c a p reform
the aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain improve distribution trade policy avoid the constant increase in food speculation
take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non agricultural costs and finally assure producers that all products on the e u market meet the same quality standards
mr president intellectual property infringements seem like a game but they are destroying the game
they make it impossible to compete freely and fairly and they allow the players who cheat most to win that is the players who do not respect the rules do not pay their taxes and who do not protect the rights of either their workers or their customers
in this report we got beyond the term piracy once and for all
we feel that the term piracy is mistaken because we do not really see that it has any relation with boarding ships at sea or with the mythical legends of pirates
infringers themselves have even sometimes waved this term as a flag to pass themselves off as freedom fighters however their
battle is in vain because they end up serving the interests of large multinationals that want access to content without having to pay for it
let us call infringements what they really are infringements
let us call a spade a spade
the observatory in alicante where the trade marks and designs registration office is already operating successfully will make the true figures which are not so evident to everybody plain to see
the observatory will make proposals and above all provide information on the situation in the sector and compliance with regulations
the text also includes an additional data protection guarantee
as the observatory will act as a meeting point between the public and private sectors proper representation of all the actors involved will be crucial
that is why i have insisted on including the creative industries primarily to take account of the employment aspect as well as an annual evaluation in the management report to assess whether the players involved are represented in a well balanced way
the observatory will undoubtedly play a very important role in the essential monitoring work to ensure respect for intellectual property rights
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we know that without young people there is no future and we are also sure that with high rates of youth unemployment europe may become unsustainable
we must provide solutions these solutions will not materialise through labour reforms such as the one approved last friday in my country which will bring our young people even greater job insecurity and destroy their rights
the fact is that europe has a youth unemployment rate of close to twenty three percent
in my country spain unemployment affects forty nine percent of young people many of whom are educated trained and talented and who are increasingly saying how tired and fed up they are with the lack of solutions
we agree on the urgent need to approve measures to stimulate the recruitment of young people and to help small and medium sized enterprises especially those set up by young people
that is why i believe that we must ensure that training matches the requirements of the labour market as a matter of priority we must realise that an education system that is fairer in terms of the quality of education and that does away with
the quality of education and that does away with the differences between public and state subsidised private education will help to boost creativity and innovation thereby increasing students entrepreneurial spirit specialisation and mobility
could the commission explain how the e u r ten point seven billion that it estimates is owed to spain will be distributed between the various funds
with regard to the european social fund what percentage of the e u r eighty two billion that is still to be allocated will be assigned to this fund
what is this percentage in spain specifically
lastly how does the commission plan to integrate regional and local authorities and social partners into the action plans
commissioner i expect fast decisive and viable action from the commission because we do not have a single day to waste
madam president i welcome governor capriles election in yesterday s primaries as the candidate for the united democratic opposition in venezuela i
that a change of power will be possible if the majority of venezuelans in that much loved country so wish it with all the electoral guarantees enshrined in democracy
good luck venezuela
mr president apart from the eighty million poor people we are talking about a further forty three million people find it hard to manage to eat animal protein twice a week
this situation could become worse because these people the ones who have problems managing to eat animal protein twice a week could find themselves in dire straits as the economic crisis
even more acute this is not exactly the best time for the european union to be cutting the food aid budget in the run up to the next multi annual financial framework period
the agreement endorsed by parliament extends food aid under the conditions requested by this chamber it also represents however a certain level of resignation towards the block that some member states have kept up for several months in the council
ladies and gentlemen i would like to urge all of you here to take whatever initiatives are necessary to keep food aid going beyond twenty fourteen
parliament should not stand idly by in the face of such an important humanitarian issue
we should not accept the status quo and this means we should use the negotiations for the next multi annual financial framework period to express our opinion
issue and to push for an agreement between the council of ministers and parliament to ensure that aid for the poorest can be maintained beyond that date
food banks have been able to provide a noteworthy social service thanks to european aid and this should not be paralysed through the selfishness of some governments
this service has benefited thirteen million people which has enabled us with minimal effort to make the common agricultural policy a bit more important
mr president the regulation we are debating today is not perfect it alone cannot resolve the difficulties of a sector that has structural problems and also because of the economic context we are living in today problems relating to the current situation
although it is not perfect however this regulation is a decisive step forwards in the right direction
the thing is that even though we all realised some time ago that no market is perfect we also realised there was a great need to include as many regulations and measures as we could to protect our farmers in this area all this also impacts on people s food security
we also realised there was a great need for us to allow compulsory contracts for a minimum duration and a maximum amount at least as a defence mechanism because our farmers obviously cannot negotiate on the same footing as distributors middlemen or collectors
there is still much to be done
we will have to improve the security networks and make them quicker to react and more effective
we will have to work decisively to ensure that the sector is better coordinated within the value chain verify that quotas are not being improperly distributed especially in certain areas and promote the quality policy
with our positive vote however and everything that is still to be done there is no doubt that many dairy farmers will today be able to see that parliament has defended their most basic labour right to be able to live in dignity on the earnings from their work
mr president mr bové s report illustrates well the disastrous consequences that this agreement would have if it is approved
this agreement which would extend the quotas for certain fruit and vegetable products makes absolutely no sense if the figures are not respected
we should remember that the spanish federation of associations of producers and exporters of fruits vegetables flowers and live plants complained to parliament s committee on petitions about the mass influx of tomatoes that flooded through perpignan priced below the level set in the agreement
illegal situations such as this put european farmers at a competitive disadvantage
we should also note that our farmers have to abide by rigorous quality environmental and social standards that our moroccan partners do not always comply with
to finish i will like to raise the issue of the sahara
the charter of the united nations describes the sahara as an autonomous region saying that any exploitation of its resources should specifically benefit the local population
in addition the united nations does not recognise the sovereignty of the kingdom of morocco over this region
the european union must make sure it complies with international law
i am in favour of an agreement with morocco in favour of an agreement in which the european union establishes rigorous mechanisms to control quotas and prices an anti dumping agreement which will not exploit moroccan farmers and above all will allow european farmers to make a decent living
it is clear that the current agreement does not do this
mr president last year parliament s committee on petitions asked the european commission to amend the entry price system for fruit and vegetables entering the union this system allows products from third countries to enter fraudulently as the european anti fraud office itself has stated
these products are primarily moroccan tomatoes
the governments of spain france and italy issued a statement last year that made the same request
we can combat this fraud by amending the regulation on application of the common market organisation for agricultural products because the problem will not be resolved by aligning the customs code commissioner
for several years i have been speaking up within the spanish about the need to stop new concessions to morocco until such time as the european union has the necessary instruments in place to ensure compliance with the agreement currently in force
the european commission argues that the member states should control imports
however what the commission does not say is that the current entry price system prevents national customs authorities from being able to properly trace the prices declared by importers in order to check for irregularities
amend the regulation on the application of the c m o for agricultural products and part of the problem will be solved if you do not the legal loophole in european legislation will prevent national authorities from doing their jobs properly
mr president ladies and gentlemen we are holding yet another debate on a summit
many summits have taken place and are all announced to great fanfare trying to create an expectation that diminishes every day
these summits are starting to lose credibility because they do not contribute to resolving the crisis
the same agreements are reiterated time and time again at summits
it should be noted that whilst there is no progress on political union and on strengthening this parliament and the executive power of the european commission summits will keep on taking place but the economic crisis will get worse
two ideas very briefly the first the need to insist on the fact that responsible solidarity and the fulfilling of duties are the
the building blocks from which europe is built the second that the immediate use of unspent structural funds must be authorised
the sums involved can easily allow the unemployment figures among young european citizens to be tackled
madam president from the european parliament i wish to pay tribute to all women today because despite the fact that we have made much progress since march nineteen eleven when women took to the streets to demand the vote and better working conditions i think that women s equality is still a long way away
today women can work without having to get permission from anyone but in many cases they continue to earn less than men for similar work which is unacceptable
we must also remember women in rural areas whose work goes unnoticed
i think that another uncomfortable truth but one which we must continue to denounce is violence against women
this year alone an excessive number of women have already been murdered leaving aside serious threats from those who believe they have the right to perpetrate physical or psychological violence against women
it is time to say enough and to say it loud and clear
from this parliament i reiterate my commitment to the european protection order for victims and to the directive on the rights of victims which the commission put forward and which will be voted upon next june god willing
it also has to be said and i should like to remind people that motherhood is still an obstacle to the progression of women and i think this is a trend that should be changed
i want to send a message of hope many women with the help of more and more men need to advance along the path of equal opportunities rights and responsibilities
we have come a long way but there is a lot left to do
i have to admit that i do not believe in quotas in any way shape or form but i must say that something has to be done and i agree with
many of you and of course with ms reding in opening this debate and advancing along that path so that women regain the place that they deserve and to that end you can count on my support
mr president the climate of economic crisis and budgetary cuts affects public health care and leaves research centres without funding this is the case with the prince felipe centre which specialises in diabetes and is located in the autonomous region in which i live and this resolution is very welcome it is very appropriate
we need a single european strategy for diabetes and we need a recommendation from the council telling states that they should step up research even on stem cells that they should coordinate their results to make the best use of them and that they should establish programmes for healthy eating and lifestyle habits
in summary we must put people s health before anything else and in this case research coordinate and develop national programmes that are coordinated by the commission to obtain data about diabetes and in that way protect the lives of europeans and ensure their quality of life
if we devote more funds to this maybe some will take a little longer to recover but those who currently have problems will definitely have a better quality of life and we as states as a council and as a commission will be fulfilling one of our obligations which is to watch over the health of our citizens
mr president of the many issues being discussed in this debate i would like to emphasise that of the emissions trading market a market that has certainly been flawed from the outset
however the current restriction of allowances and the economic crisis have led to a drastic fall in the price of carbon that is to say the price has fallen so much that it is now cheap to pollute
the design of the policy for this market therefore requires an urgent revamp as its deterioration threatens all our green efforts and all of the european union s green policies
if emission allowances are not valued it provides an incentive to increase emissions polluting industries will not invest in new technologies and worse still
the funding of important projects will be in jeopardy such as for example energy efficiency projects or carbon storage plants
that is the risk
it is down to us the commission and parliament to address it
mr president few refugees are permanently resettled in europe
my country spain has only just embarked on this experience
these cases however are of urgent need
as well as the news coming out of tunisia members have seen this for themselves during trips to camps in syria for palestinian refugees who fled iraq
another more institutional aspect is the balance of power between parliament and the council
there are many good parliamentarians but few are as tenacious as our rapporteur the courageous mr rui
mr rui tavares who has fought to ensure the new powers conferred to the european parliament under the treaty of lisbon have been maintained
i must also refer to the continued efforts of the united nations high commissioner for refugees without whom this success would not have been possible
the u n h c r has ensured we are all aware of the urgency of this report over and above the long drawn out legal discussions so that the funds can be used as soon as possible given that they are so urgently needed
finally i would like to thank you commissioner and i hope that you and your good heart will have the satisfaction of moving forward with the asylum package next month
mr president the european social model that we are so proud of is not only based on our pensions education and health systems but also on the way in which we view the balance between business owners and workers in companies
the employment reform that has been approved by the government of spain without dialogue and without consensus breaks with that social model and distances us from the objectives of the europe twenty twenty strategy both in terms of creating jobs and in terms of the quality of these jobs
a labour reform alone does not create employment it is economic growth that does so
what a labour law does do is define the conditions under which workers join companies the conditions under which they remain in them and the conditions under which they leave them
with this reform thanks to which eighty percent of workers will be unprotected as they will not be covered by collective agreements companies will be able to dismiss workers if their revenue falls or unilaterally change their working hours
if their revenue falls or unilaterally change their working hours what is clear is that workers will be entering the labour market with greater insecurity will remain in it with more fear and will leave it with less compensation
that is why this reform which attacks the european social model and which seeks to improve the competitiveness of the spanish economy solely on the basis of workers conditions deserves to be met by a general strike such as the one called for tomorrow in spain in order to defend this social model
mr president mr barroso the first thing i should say is that the spanish delegation of the group of the european people s party approves of and supports the two packages that have been presented today both the employment package and the solidarity aid for greece which is consistent with your overall proposal
ladies and gentlemen there is no denying that we are experiencing difficult times and daily events remind us that the crisis is still far from over
unavoidably the focus has shifted back to spain
alarm bells have been ringing in the markets without justification partly fuelled by statements that i consider to be inappropriate mr president
some of those have been made in the context of important elections in which opponents on both sides are making my country a dialectical element of their confrontation
naturally we do not welcome any of these references
furthermore as a way of turning the attention away from their own problems others are showing little political sensitivity in their dealings with us
today in parliament some have failed to show any as the italians would say and there has been a lack of political tact
ladies and gentlemen the situation in the markets does not reflect spain s strength
we are a solvent country and we are entirely capable of tackling our debts
the spanish debt remains below the european average and the spanish government is fully committed to fulfilling the deficit targets agreed with the e u
mr swoboda mr rajoy has never said that he cannot meet the targets set by the european union
on the contrary he said that he is ready to meet each and every one of those targets and he repeats that on a daily basis
the spanish government in the few months it has been in office has adopted and will continue to adopt very ambitious measures in order to guarantee fiscal consolidation and lay the foundations for greater competitiveness job creation and growth
in the outlook it made public yesterday the international monetary fund itself admitted that the forecast was made prior to any analysis of the decisions and measures currently being taken by the spanish government
we have adopted other measures the general state budget for twenty twelve which we believe will guarantee that we will meet the deficit target this year the organic law on budgetary stability a reform of the education and health care systems which will be presented this month
a reform of the education and health care systems which will be presented this month and allow for an adjustment of e u r ten billion and the reform of the financial sector which is going to help the financial institutions to bring in more than e u r fifty billion
in short spain is meeting the targets set by the commission and we are calling on everyone to be responsible
we all need to find a way out of this together spain with everyone else without a doubt the criticisms being made are not at all helpful either all the countries find a way to act together to bring about growth and a new direction or else it will be difficult for us to move forwards under the conditions proposed by the commission
mr president mr romeva would you like mr rajoy to speak in parliament
i think that is a good idea and i would have no objections
mr rajoy however is not the protagonist of this crisis
the protagonist of the crisis is the legacy left behind by the socialist communist and green left wing parties in spain who handed over the worst legacy in political history and this was after they had been handed the best legacy ever left by any previous government
mr president this morning i read in a major german newspaper that spain and argentina have clashed over an oil company
that is precisely the wrong way to raise this issue
the conflict is between europe and argentina and beyond that with the great european value of legal security and respect for international trade relations
the european institutions have excellent lawyers who can identify the appropriate instruments in primary or secondary e u law in order to neutralise the arbitrariness of the argentine authorities
i am a humble professor of public law and i offer them my assistance
the european union s credibility in the eyes of its citizens is now at stake
mr president the committee on agriculture and rural development agrees with the final objective of this directive to try to adapt the composition of our energy mix through taxation but we are facing a very complex debate
full of difficulties in economic social and environmental terms it is important to maintain a balance that helps us to progress in environmental matters of course but we want to avoid causing any damage to the economy and creating greater social crises than the ones we are already experiencing
that is the case with agriculture
as you are all aware energy costs account for an increasingly high proportion of fixed costs for agricultural holdings at a time when we are also debating the crises taking place in the raw materials markets with the prospect of a loss of subsidies and an increase in health and environmental demands which reduce their profit margins
we have therefore called for two things
firstly to maintain the zero level of taxation for the energy component which is currently linked to drafting and complying with strategies for energy efficiency and energy saving in the rural sector and to incorporate agriculture
incorporate agriculture in the sectors considered to be at risk of carbon leakage so as to be able to have access to the reductions allowed for c o emissions
in other words we want a policy that is more demanding in environmental terms but which maintains the balance that makes our agricultural sector viable at a time of change and uncertainty in that sector
mr president ladies and gentlemen we are experiencing great controversy the key reference points of which are the concepts of austerity and growth
if we listen to the noise that is building it would seem that the idea of growth were a brilliant modern day invention
nothing could be further from the truth
since nineteen ninety seven the so called stability and growth pact has reigned supreme in europe
as a result of this a great many of the policies that the european institutions have implemented such as cohesion policy regional policy and research policy are policies designed to create growth and pursue the development and well being of the citizens
therefore and i am saying this to the commission and the members of this parliament who have a better chance of making themselves heard there is no issue on our part when it comes to being in this debate which we can face with our heads held high
that is my minority opinion among the non attached members
madam president please allow me first to thank all my colleagues and in particular the shadow rapporteurs who have helped with the drafting of this report leading to a much more robust version
we are all aware that this year is the twentieth anniversary of the launch of the single market which should be the driver of economic activity and growth in europe essential for exiting the crisis and achieving the europe twenty twenty objectives
during the next eight years the creation of the internal market needs to be compatible with its development with an extensive framework of protection for consumers with growth and rights that
and rights that lead to dynamism and confidence with transparency the basic principle of democracy and good governance as mentioned this afternoon by commissioner barnier and cooperation between the commission and parliament
it is now time to develop the regulatory framework for consumer protection and preparation particularly when it comes to vulnerable consumers
we are aware that the different vulnerability situations both endogenous and exogenous make the adoption of an overall legislative tool difficult
this means we have to use a cross sectional approach to deal with the vulnerability problem that takes the different needs abilities and circumstances of consumers into account
aware of the current deficiencies the commission has focused its strategy on improving information and education for consumers
given that it is an ambitious proposal it is not enough to protect vulnerable consumers as their vulnerability derives precisely from their lack of assertiveness and understanding of the
information they receive the available options or their lack of knowledge of the current systems for complaint and compensation particularly in the case of cross border online consumption
for those reasons in order to resolve the deficiencies that is the problems there is a need to adopt a strategy to support vulnerable consumers and for both the commission and the member states to introduce specific measures into their legislation to ensure appropriate protection
to ensure appropriate protection which goes further than simply information particularly in those matters where the highest number of consumer complaints occur the financial sector the complexity of which implies the possibility of any consumer being vulnerable
call goes out therefore to the financial services to redouble their efforts to provide understandable truthful information filled with clear explanations using straightforward language about the nature of the products and services on offer to the food sector with respect
with respect to the advertising of foods high in fat salt and sugar informing children and young people who are most susceptible to the advertising for these foods to the transport sector on which vulnerable persons often still encounter difficulties when travelling to the energy and telecommunications sectors
the energy and telecommunications sectors where the lack of transparency in some cases leads to added complications for consumers for example deciding which tariff best fits their needs in the energy sector and for access to justice where consumers can have difficulties in accessing the existing mechanisms
existing mechanisms
the commission and member states and also mr gallardon of the spanish ministry of justice if you will allow me to appeal to him are therefore requested not to move backwards on rights
therefore requested not to move backwards on rights but to go against the flow in these difficult times using intelligence and good governance to favour an alternative outcome to consumer disputes
finally i would like to mention that any one of us could become vulnerable consumers and i appreciate all the help provided by the other shadow rapporteurs in fortifying this report
madam president commissioner to be honest i have a feeling of despair almost frustration that i must share with someone
allow me to do so with you this evening
this is the third or fourth debate we have held recently in this house on the situation of youth unemployment across europe we have had debate after debate while youth unemployment rates are rocketing reaching almost fifty percent of the active population in some member states
fifty percent of the active population in some member states many young people are left with no form of social or unemployment protection and the situation is shifting from worrying
unsustainable and from unsustainable to tragic yet the commission presents itself once again in parliament as if it were a mere political commentator or just another analyst rather than the true executive body of the union that it is and moreover that we need
commissioner governing means establishing priorities and taking the initiative with the aim of achieving a purpose or goal and the commission is failing to do that
governing does not mean simply restructuring funds nor even announcing it so as to look good to the public but instead presenting an ambitious long term fast acting strategy that can put an end to youth unemployment
governing does not mean resigning oneself to a rate of youth unemployment that is above twenty percent and being satisfied with a pilot project of e u r four million which is derisory given the scale of the problem we are facing
governing does not mean giving in to pressure from the college of commissioners or other member states in the council that are trying to convince us that we shall only emerge from this financial crisis and this new wave of recession by giving up salaries employment rights or compensation and that a precarious future is the only thing that lies ahead for this generation
if it were true commissioner that it is only through precarity that we can regain competitiveness and that just by being more precarious we can become more competitive then zimbabwe would be the most competitive country and it is not
sweden finland and denmark are instead and they are characterised precisely by their exemplary model of relations and a model of guaranteed employment rights
madam president employment is far more than just a citizen s right it is a tool by which people are connected with the system and an instrument for social integration
therefore the more unemployment there is the greater people s political disaffection and that is why commissioner it is of no use to me whatsoever to hear you talking about matters of competence to avoid doing anything about youth unemployment
what is more commissioner when it was necessary to make a loose interpretation of the treaties in order to create the european financial stability fund for example you did so and when the treaties had to be revised in order to fulfil or meet the crazed demands of a particular member state as regards austerity we also did so
this then is the point i am trying to make
you have for example the youth employment guarantee which needs no explanation
you should fight to increase its budget use the european social fund as an instrument if necessary design a cofinanced and supportive implementing mechanism that provides greater help to countries with the highest levels of unemployment put pressure on the worst affected countries to make further changes to the policy of social suffocation and remember that behind every statistic there is a person suffering
then you may think as i do that deciding who holds responsibility is the least important thing because for all our citizens particularly young people we are the ones who are entirely responsible
madam president commissioner i would like to thank the committee on international trade the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done
in general terms we have a good regulation on the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance which is necessary specifically with regard to some measures concerning the monitoring of standards for importing textile products that could be damaging to e u production
we are concerned however by the exclusion from the generalised system of preferences from twenty fourteen of certain countries that are classified as having upper middle incomes for example latin american countries
we are concerned as to what is happening with these middle income countries that have a lack of diversification in their exports
why not introduce a criterion of diversification of exports
this could create a two speed system countries such as costa rica cuba and ecuador would benefit from it differentiating them from potentially developed countries such as china and brazil
i therefore believe that we must support a transition period and that amendments are going to be tabled during that transition period in order to adapt to that situation and to those countries and provide the opportunity to begin negotiations and trade agreements with them so that they can benefit from it
mr president i supported the report by ms nedelcheva when i was able to accompany her on the mission to the democratic republic of congo along with other members i have seen few peoples with a greater manifest desire to establish democracy and participate in it
however in order to believe in democracy a people needs to believe in its state and its government and that will only be possible with electoral support or external aid
they also need there to be a requirement to fight corruption and to bring an end to the obscene paradox of living in poverty in one of the most resource rich countries in the world
it must be stated and also condemned that part of the violence that they are experiencing is imported or at least fuelled by the unscrupulous multinationals from europe and other continents that are capable of participating in corruption not caring whether they are fuelling the battles for those resources in order to gain favour with those who are running certain areas
therefore baroness ashton although it does not fall entirely within your competence i will say that a greater demand for traceability and transparency from european and other multinationals that operate there would be as useful for the development of this people as the aid that we can provide on an electoral or technical level
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteurs for the valuable work that they have presented to us
ladies and gentlemen we are now debating the two pack ' having adopted the six pack ' this comes after almost all the heads of state or government signed two international treaties outside of e u legislation and
e u legislation and after many other pieces of european legislation created more e u authorities to supervise banks stock exchanges insurance and the risks to the economic system
we have a range of texts and more texts reports and proposals dealing with new economic assessment criteria new processes and procedures
should we not stop and apply what has already been adopted
in the face of the instability that europe is experiencing we need precisely the opposite stability and legal security
we do not need a hotchpotch of successive legal discoveries
i do not know if i am dreaming ladies and gentlemen
mr president the situation created by the rescue package is very concerning
the spanish people are not being told the whole truth about the new debt that the spanish government and state are taking on as a public debt to support the private debt
the spanish government has asked for aid that it previously said it did not want and it is presenting it ridiculously as a triumph as a fellow member has said during this debate
this is not a triumph but a failure by bankia and others
i stress here that there is no policy that is right for europe other than that fostered by the french government behind which we need to close parliamentary ranks as we will not come out of the debt crisis without harmonised growth for everyone
we do of course need all the necessary supervision as stated in the two reports but simultaneous anti speculative growth is essential as mentioned in some of the measures in both reports and also in other reports
i ask for clarity and transparency as well as balance as my colleague mr sánchez presedo said
madam president i have been denouncing female genital mutilation since i became a member of parliament
this silent and accepted crime is suffered by millions of women and girls throughout the world seventy million i repeat seventy million
an unbearable figure for those who stop to examine the terrible consequences of these practices hidden under the guises of psychological health and religious reasons all of which are false
the truth is that circumcision preferentially practised on fourteen year old girls and even those aged one year old can lead to death by haemorrhagic shock and at best cause and bring about strong psychological consequences from the trauma
we should strive with all our efforts in europe to eradicate this violation of human rights which infringes on the right to equal opportunities and puts health at risk
it is ladies and gentlemen abuse cruelty and torture against girls and this degrading treatment also occurs in europe
we must therefore activate all the available prevention mechanisms in our legal system and encourage our judges to act to prevent the genital mutilation
of girls in europe punishing those who carry it out e u law has to speak with a single voice to combat the mutilation on our soil
lastly i call on civil society and ngos to become actively involved in education and prevention campaigns
there is still a long way to go but we are a large group who will not give up as we owe it to the seventy million mutilated women
mr president commissioner i am fully aware that one of the reasons why we have approved the milk package is precisely to adapt the sector with a view to a market without milk quotas in twenty fifteen
it is also the case however that as this date for liberalisation approaches uncertainty is increasing within the sector as there is no clear exit strategy and the reasons behind the sector requesting caution and thought about our decision also increase
reasons for example like the belief in maintaining vineyard planting rights or maintaining sugar quotas until at least twenty twenty reasons such as uncertainty in the sector surrounding the real effects of the milk package and whether we
we have had time to assess them properly and also reasons such as uncertainty about where the common agricultural policy is heading and in particular its budget that is about the part of the income that does not come from the markets and which affects our farmers
therefore commissioner what we are asking you to pass on to mr cioloş is that we should not undertake a patchy policy dismantling our protection system without a serious and rigorous analysis as the effects on our farmers are irreversible
postpone the end of the quota until twenty fifteen to a date the sector feels more assured about and initiate an open and transparent debate on the regulation mechanisms given that the markets are increasingly unfair and the farmers are increasingly less protected
mr president many members of this house have listened to the voices of our people the voices on the street
commissioner you said that this is a yes or no agreement
the members of this house also have a responsibility regarding the yes or no
we are saying no because this agreement evidently creates confusion
it clarifies neither intellectual property rights nor the rights of internet users
are we concerned about intellectual property rights
yes we are
is the anti counterfeiting trade agreement a solution to this
no it is not a solution because there are two issues that need to be tackled not one legal issue but two political issues firstly the determination of the fight against counterfeiting and piracy and secondly a new legislative framework for the
piracy and secondly a new legislative framework for the digital environment for which the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament has repeatedly asked you and which it is requesting again
this is your opportunity
do not turn your back on society because tomorrow you will come up against a no and you will have no way out
mr president it has been said that in order for things to get better sometimes the chaos needs to get worse
the feeling of powerlessness was such that europe was forced to react and it did so for the good of everyone because the big winner of this summit was the euro
this triumph has revived the hope that europe is emerging from its paralysis moving from thought towards action
ladies and gentlemen it was essential to adopt short term measures at this summit in order to guarantee financial stability along with long term measures in order to solve the union s shortcomings
in this case immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important
the imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint irrevocable and irreversible project
ladies and gentlemen we welcome such important decisions as giving the european stability mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt incidentally the current spanish government has always advocated this theory
it will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments
these decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability which must be the european union s highest priority in the short term
ladies and gentlemen this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles
as i have already said it is the time to support europe
ladies and gentlemen spain is providing and implementing in record time the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of spanish democracy which includes major employment reforms
it is also carrying out a financial reform based on complete transparency all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets
we also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration using four building blocks banking union fiscal union a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy
mr president the history of first the community and then of the european union has always shown that not only do we overcome crises but also we emerge from them stronger
i am delighted that once again we have achieved this
mr president ladies and gentlemen all our attention is focused on the banks and time and again people say that they are the lifeblood of society
that image is probably right but let us take into account that any body is held up by a backbone and joints
well the backbone and joints of the society that we call europe are its transport networks and energy infrastructure
it is essential as is being said this evening in parliament that we mobilise private funding and where appropriate public funding
this is also an opportunity to promote the issuance of private debt backed by the european institutions specifically aimed at achieving these aims fairly and also open to any investor
i would congratulate the rapporteurs on their work and also the commission on its clear impetus behind these projects
mr president commissioner president in office of the council i welcome the new presidency i am a veteran member of the non aligned movement which was led by your country and which has a strong desire for cyprus to be unified as opposed to under military occupation
ladies and gentlemen perhaps we should take this opportunity for a broader reform of the court of justice of the european union but the aspirations of the commission and the rapporteur are very positive and must be unanimously supported as they were in our committee
the flexibility and smooth running of the court of justice are crucial and i question those qualities in the light of the new jurisdiction on patents which has now been delayed
congratulations to the rapporteur and let us move forward with the reform of the court of justice
mr president commissioner reding my country has taken too many steps backward since the people s party came to power there have been repeated continual attempts to retreat on consolidated rights as seen by the silencing of those who express dissent such as consumer associations
the threat to the facua consumers in action group which is an encroachment on articles sixteen and seventeen of the spanish constitution by ms mato s ministry is a dangerous attack not
only on freedom of expression and opinion but also on the right of consumers to a high level of protection which are basic principles of democracy set out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union
i therefore call on mr rajoy s government to reverse the outrageous attempt to ban f a c u a and i call on the commission to guarantee the protection of
spanish consumers rights and to take action against the attempts by spain s current government to erode the rights and functions of consumer associations
madam president commissioner first of all i would like to draw attention to the excellent work done by ms mcavan the rapporteur and also the other shadow rapporteurs in order to reach this
in order to reach this agreement at first reading this was very important because the regulation we adopted in twenty ten was coming into force and it needed to be amended
it was not amended because it was a flawed piece of legislation quite the contrary rather it was amended because as has been said recent events took place of which we are all aware showing that there was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again it was also necessary to strengthen certain
was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again it was also necessary to strengthen certain specific points concerning pharmacovigilance and the safety of medicines once placed on the market
as we have already heard from now on marketing authorisation holders who do not renew a marketing authorisation or who withdraw or request the withdrawal or suspension of an authorisation will
suspension of an authorisation will be obliged to inform the competent authorities of the real reasons and motives for withdrawing or suspending it
this is a major success for transparency and it will prevent the market authorisation holder from trying to conceal the real reasons behind its decision
moreover in the event that any of these actions is carried out in a third country all the member states in which that medicine is marketed must be informed
all this will improve transparency and safety without the european medicines agency and national agencies being overly burdened as a result
the second important amendment we have achieved is that all authorised products that are subject to some kind of post authorisation safety study will be systematically included on the list of products subject to such monitoring
lastly we cannot forget that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role and parliament should therefore adopt this proposal
mr president the agreement reached by parliament and the council reflects what was unanimously approved by the member states concerned in the international maritime organisation
these seas have disconcerting levels of acidification
moreover their capacity for regeneration is very limited
the fuels required are going to be more expensive and therefore there are plans for financial aid for businesses which is very reasonable
some members however have sought to have the requirements for new fuels applied to all the union s seas
we would find ourselves with a paradox in that we would be trying to solve an environmental problem of some member states by creating a major economic problem in the mediterranean which does not have that environmental problem but does have other environmental problems the costs of which we are not seeking to impose on the other member states
the treaty is very clear
sensitive areas must be protected
however not all areas are equally sensitive
mr president i should like once more to thank all those who have made it possible for this directive to become a reality the secretariat the commission the rapporteur all those i am forgetting to mention and all my fellow members who have supported us
i should like to say to every single victim without exception that for us they and their families have faces names and are real people and it is specifically on their behalf
single victim without exception that for us they and their families have faces names and are real people and it is specifically on their behalf that we will work to ensure this directive is truly effective and with the commitment and support of commissioner reding of which i have no doubt whatsoever is quickly and efficiently implemented which is what all of us and all citizens want
citizens want
i think there are various victims associations that would have wanted and continue to want their own directive but i will make sure they know that the directive we shall vote on tomorrow does not overlook a single victim and therefore does not overlook them either
i am certain that this is the first important step and that it will be followed by many other steps that will open the doors of justice which have been closed to victims for too long
when i am asked as i often am in my country what i do in europe i will be able to say with great pride that i am legislating in support of victims
that work is a great honour to me personally and it motivates me to continue working
i am sure that with the support and commitment of all those who are not only working here in the e u but also in our own countries as well as your support ladies and gentlemen together we will succeed in putting an end to the situation of unjust neglect in which victims find themselves
mr president mr turmes has done an admirable job because he needed courage to move forward with this type of legislation and he has been capable of neutralising the obstacles which were many and cleverly placed
it was worth the effort because energy efficiency and energy savings are requirements of any energy policy worthy of that name
we must welcome significant measures such as the requirement to renovate public buildings the imposition of a cumulative energy savings percentage on energy companies as well as compulsory audits imposed on large private companies
the work done by mr turmes and the other rapporteurs will be in vain if it is not accompanied by decisive action from the member states
this action must in turn be accompanied by a firm commitment to the targets by european regions towns and the public
i would like to highlight the participation of the public
currently what we are seeing is a great deal of frivolousness among the authorities and the public
is it not true ladies and gentlemen that in the harsh european winter we see people sitting on street terraces with heating
mr turmes we should not spare any efforts in order to try to save energy
mr president the rapporteur ms garcía pérez should be congratulated on her work and on the agreement reached between parliament and the council of ministers
it is shame that the council is not represented here tonight with us
the new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures and that is good news
it is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications given that it increases the exposure of european products
i think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened and that a legal basis for
defending the european union logo in those third countries is created as i honestly think that the protection of european products in third countries should be a fundamental objective
it is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and i will say it again it is a shame that the council is not here to hear it because the original quality package proposed
the commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement leaving it as i said a little empty
i think the council s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable as they refused to listen to parliament s reasonable positions
supply management by means of designations of origin should have been defended and will of course be defended in the single common market organisation
mr president the trade agreement with the central american countries colombia and peru is a significant agreement and the idea behind the safeguard clause with all the amendments we have presented is for it to be a quick easy and guaranteed process
we have presented amendments to protect european production in accordance with the treaties and to establish safety mechanisms for both european production and production in the countries where the agreement applies
the outermost regions need protection given the lack of diversification of crops and the economic aspect as a large number of jobs are affected
jobs are affected over ten thousand direct jobs and thirty five thousand indirect jobs in spain in a population that has been suffering unemployment and because of their specific nature
bananas in the canary islands for example have a very specific place in agriculture culture and gastronomy
the agreement is also required where it will be applied central america colombia and peru given that trade is essential for development and development means workers rights sustainability and profits for the producer
mr president the rapporteur has done a very good job but i would like to take this opportunity within this context to say that our prose is very confused as anyone who looks at european legislation would tell us
we are forgetting what von pufendorf taught us namely that general laws should be few in number and they should be correctly understood
to that end those who enact laws ought to be as clear as possible
montesquieu always stressed that legal language must be precise and concise
in other words we must avoid using complex doublespeak full of neologisms and unjustified linguistic borrowings because it produces an evil web where traps lie in wait and arbitrariness resides
in this parliament we deal with complex subjects but it is our obligation to ensure they are passed on to citizens in an accessible and comprehensible manner
it often happens that even legal professionals judges and lawyers despair at our texts
good prose ladies and gentlemen is a courteous gesture by the legislator and a way of showing respect for citizens
mr president i would like to say to mr eppink that he has just used the little time he had to dish out words of insult and condemnation from a position of absolute ignorance
is he familiar with the spanish constitution
because all vice president vidal quadras said nothing more and nothing less was that the provisions of the spanish constitution should be enforced anything else was merely the personal comments of an individual which had no bearing on anything and which i respect as such but with which i do not agree
mr president ladies and gentlemen there is an old principle that has passed from the legal to the political world and it is ' which means agreements must be kept '
by that i am referring to the important measures adopted by the european council in june to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves
since these agreements were adopted market pressure has eased with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs
ladies and gentlemen the european council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union
the agreement between the twenty seven member states on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers
however i must criticise the biased interpretations that have unilaterally been made in this respect
it is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed
we urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions
a joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented
the euro s survival depends on the rapid creation of an effective banking union
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the advantages of the single market are unquestionable increased competition an increased supply of products and
services job creation more affordable prices for consumers and greater protection but they are still not sufficient and we cannot become complacent
however the cultural linguistic protectionist and bureaucratic barriers are preventing the public and businesses from being able to fully enjoy the advantages of the single market
eighteen months ago we celebrated the announcement of the twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence in the single market
unfortunately an agreement has still not been reached on the majority of the proposals as the commission acknowledged in last week s communication
commissioner ladies and gentlemen the urgent nature of the crisis requires us to be ambitious to go much further and to reach agreements as soon as possible in order to boost growth employment and the confidence of the public and businesses in the single market
mr president i would also like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other members who have done a very good job on this reform
the financial crisis has increased due to the existence of complex and strange transferable securities that are linked to derivative instruments and negotiations outside the official markets with the aim of achieving high profits very quickly
we need to attract financial transactions to a transparent market in order to guarantee good forming of prices and competition between transferable products
above all however it is vital that the information provided is understandable to investors who must have full knowledge in order to freely give consent to the risks they are taking on
there is no point in transparency shedding light on the situation if confusion regarding the configuration of transferable products blinds the public s understanding
mr president i like ms thyssen s report because i believe that anything that involves strengthening parliament s role and authority in the political debate is heading in the right direction
too often we hear the european institutions being accused of being of poor democratic quality
this is a statement made lightly that on this occasion has no place in this debate
there is however a place for pointing out that parliament has the same legitimacy as any national parliament and probably even compared to some it is governed by more transparent rules and also allows its members greater freedom
all economic measures must therefore pass through the filter that parliament represents before being finally adopted and also subsequently in order to examine their implementation and results
the group of experts appointed to check that the member states are complying with the conditions imposed by the e u authorities and the representatives
of the stability mechanism must appear before this house so that we as members receive comprehensive information first hand
mr president five point three percent of the active population works in the automotive sector
the figures speak for themselves
the decline in sales in the european market combined with business strategy is generally leading to the externalisation and restructuring of businesses
there is an overcapacity crisis currently affecting ten assembly plants and potentially one hundred thousand workers
unfortunately few cases of restructuring have a long term vision generally the short term vision takes precedence with the main element being increasing competitiveness based on labour adjustments
i must tell you that on the same day that ford announced the closure of its plant in genk it informed its business in valencia that its production was to be transferred to germany in the same statement
we therefore believe that this is a general problem in europe we believe that it is essential that we create a legal framework at european level that anticipates changes and highlights the importance of social dialogue
social dialogue is vital
mr president today we are discussing four reports that seek to breathe new life into our common security and defence policy
this is a clear sign of the conviction that our security and defence have a clear european dimension contrary to the beliefs of the eurosceptic minorities some of whom can be found in this house
i would like to thank mr danjean for his commitment to finding a consensus when preparing his report which contains other important contributions from the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament
these include the references to effective multilateralism the principle of the responsibility to protect and the concept of human security
we would like to see those aspects included in a future revision of the european defence strategy
we stressed too that a strong c s d p is also important for our transatlantic alliance
i must mention another of the challenges that is assuming significant importance for our global security cyber security and cyber defence aspects that are dealt with in a report that we are discussing today as well
we hope that its proposals will be included in the new european cyber security strategy
against a backdrop of severe economic and financial crisis in which the member states are being forced to cut their defence budgets it is all the more necessary to implement the european pooling and sharing programmes '
it is therefore more important than ever to strengthen the role of the european defence agency over which there is much debate today
in conclusion we can relaunch european security and defence and we can do so with president van rompuy s plan for the december twenty thirteen council
thank you all four rapporteurs
mr president ladies and gentlemen once again the defence of the general interest by the commission and parliament is clashing with entrenched national self interest in the council
given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions it is essential to find a balance
there is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework
the spanish delegation of the group of the european people s party and i on its behalf must reiterate that the presidency s proposal is in our opinion unacceptable
a cut of e u r seventy five billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the european commission is futile and of no use to anyone
that is not the only problem these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the red line that spain drew at the start of this work
ladies and gentlemen now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth
some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit
spain however like so many other countries needs to grow increase its economic activity and create jobs
with this budget none of this will be possible it is pushing us past breaking point
ladies and gentlemen we cannot achieve more europe with far fewer resources especially if what we have is distributed unfairly
if that is the case spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the european union that means plain and simple the end to any opportunities for growth and above all any remnant of solidarity and that is precisely the direction that the european council is taking
luckily that is not the path that the commission has chosen and i must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach
in relation to this point the need for the union the need for combined efforts i want to thank mr barroso who the other day in cadiz made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the treaties in the case of any potential secession within the union
he stated clearly and unequivocally as guardian of the treaties that if part of a member state secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and therefore it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the treaty
i hope mr president that this can be recognised and that the commission s sure and steady approach can remain alive as a guarantee for us all
